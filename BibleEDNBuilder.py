### GENERAL FUNCTIONS FOR DATOM CREATION

# random UID creator
def createUID():
	letters = string.ascii_letters
	return(''.join(random.choice(letters) for i in range(9)))

# Datom creator. The base structure is [datomNumber datomType datomValue UserNumber]. I hardcode the user number for a random value.
def createDatom(datomNumber, datomType, datomValue):
	return("[" + str(datomNumber) + " " + datomType + " " + str(datomValue) + " 536870912]")

# Creates a children datom. Child of a page, or child of a block it's the same. Inputs are the datomNumber (address) of the parent, and the datomNumber (address) of the child.
def createChildrenDatom(datomNumber, childNumber):
	datomType = ":block/children"
	return createDatom(datomNumber, datomType, childNumber)

# Creates a random UID for a datom. Every datom MUST have a unique UID for Athens to import correctly. Input is the datomNumber (address)
def createUIDDatom(datomNumber):
	datomValue = "\"" + createUID() + "\""
	datomType = ":block/uid"
	return createDatom(datomNumber, datomType, datomValue)

# Creates a flag for the block to be opened. Input is datomNumber (address)
def createOpenDatom(datomNumber):
	datomType = ":block/open"
	datomValue = "true"
	return createDatom(datomNumber, datomType, datomValue)

# Creates a flag for the block to be closed. Input is datomNumber (address)
def createClosedDatom(datomNumber):
	datomType = ":block/open"
	datomValue = "false"
	return createDatom(datomNumber, datomType, datomValue)

# Creates a page title. The fact that a datom has a title property will flag it as a page for Athens. Inputs are datomNumber (address) and title
def createTitleDatom(datomNumber, title):
	datomType = ":node/title"
	datomValue = "\"" + title + "\""
	return createDatom(datomNumber, datomType, datomValue)

# Creates a block string. Every datom that doesn't have a title is considered as ablock and needs a string. Inputs are datomNumber (address) and string
def createStringDatom(datomNumber, string):
	datomType = ":block/string"
	datomValue = "\"" + string + "\""
	return createDatom(datomNumber, datomType, datomValue)

# Simple function to show datoms in columm by adding a newline at every file writing step. Much easier to review output files
def writeLine(f,line):
	f.write(line+"\n")

### BIBLE / UNBOUND SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS - ASSUMING A FIXED STRUCTURE
## The bible is a main [[Bible]] page with one block per [[Bible Book]]
## Each Bible book has its own page with title "Bible Book", with one closed block per chapter, and one opened sub-block per verse

# Create the main bible page. 999 address is used not to have any interferences with other datom numbers
def terminateBiblePage(title):
	page = open('output/'+title+'page.edn', 'a')
	writeLine(page,createOpenDatom(999))
	writeLine(page,createUIDDatom(999))
	writeLine(page,createTitleDatom(999,"ðŸ“– Bible "+title))

# This will create all the [[Bible Book]] children blocks from the 999 main bible page. 9555 is added before every datomNumber to be sure they are unique
def createBookBlock(bookTuple, title):
	page = open('output/'+title+'page.edn','a')
	writeLine(page,createChildrenDatom(999,"9555"+bookTuple[0]))
	bookBlock = open('output/'+title+'page.edn','a')
	writeLine(bookBlock,createOpenDatom("9555"+bookTuple[0]))
	bookTitle = "[[ðŸ“– " + title + " " + bookTuple[1] + "]]"
	writeLine(bookBlock,createStringDatom("9555"+bookTuple[0],bookTitle))
	writeLine(bookBlock,createUIDDatom("9555"+bookTuple[0]))

# This will create a unique page for each bible book, each page having a matching title with the address [[title]] that was added above
def terminateBookPage(bookTuple, title):
	page = open('output/'+title+'page.edn', 'a')
	writeLine(page,createOpenDatom("999"+bookTuple[0]))
	writeLine(page,createUIDDatom("999"+bookTuple[0]))
	writeLine(page,createTitleDatom("999"+bookTuple[0],"ðŸ“– "+title+" "+bookTuple[1]))

# Book list and dictionnary creator from the book names list
def bookNameParser(path):
	bookNames = open('input/'+path+'/book_names.txt', 'r')
	bookList = []
	for line in bookNames:
		bookList.append(re.findall(r'(\d\d)[A-Z].(.*)',line)[0])
	return(bookList)

# This is the main piece. 
# It will run through the unbound file, 
# detect each time it sees a new book, create the dedicated page, 
# detect each time it sees a new chapter, create the dedicated block,
# detect each time it sees a new verse, create the dedicated block
# the regex outputs a list including the book ID, chapter ID, verse ID
# by design, each verse already has a unique ID, which I simply use as the datomNumber for each verse
# The strange 888, 777 are meant not to have any conflicts and to be sure each datomNumber is very unique
