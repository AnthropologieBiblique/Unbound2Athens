01O	1	1		10	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
01O	1	2		20	And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
01O	1	3		30	And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
01O	1	4		40	And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
01O	1	5		50	And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
01O	1	6		60	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
01O	1	7		70	And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
01O	1	8		80	And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
01O	1	9		90	And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
01O	1	10		100	And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
01O	1	11		110	And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.
01O	1	12		120	And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.
01O	1	13		130	And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
01O	1	14		140	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:
01O	1	15		150	and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
01O	1	16		160	And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.
01O	1	17		170	And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,
01O	1	18		180	and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
01O	1	19		190	And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
01O	1	20		200	And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
01O	1	21		210	And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
01O	1	22		220	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.
01O	1	23		230	And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
01O	1	24		240	And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind: and it was so.
01O	1	25		250	And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the ground after its kind: and God saw that it was good.
01O	1	26		260	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
01O	1	27		270	And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
01O	1	28		280	And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
01O	1	29		290	And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food:
01O	1	30		300	and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, [I have given] every green herb for food: and it was so.
01O	1	31		310	And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
01O	2	1		320	And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
01O	2	2		330	And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
01O	2	3		340	And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.
01O	2	4		350	These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.
01O	2	5		360	And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;
01O	2	6		370	but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
01O	2	7		380	And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
01O	2	8		390	And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
01O	2	9		400	And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
01O	2	10		410	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
01O	2	11		420	The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
01O	2	12		430	and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
01O	2	13		440	And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
01O	2	14		450	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
01O	2	15		460	And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
01O	2	16		470	And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
01O	2	17		480	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
01O	2	18		490	And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.
01O	2	19		500	And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
01O	2	20		510	And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.
01O	2	21		520	And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:
01O	2	22		530	and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
01O	2	23		540	And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
01O	2	24		550	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
01O	2	25		560	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
01O	3	1		570	Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?
01O	3	2		580	And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:
01O	3	3		590	but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
01O	3	4		600	And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
01O	3	5		610	for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
01O	3	6		620	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.
01O	3	7		630	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves aprons.
01O	3	8		640	And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of Jehovah God amongst the trees of the garden.
01O	3	9		650	And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?
01O	3	10		660	And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.
01O	3	11		670	And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
01O	3	12		680	And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.
01O	3	13		690	And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.
01O	3	14		700	And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:
01O	3	15		710	and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
01O	3	16		720	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
01O	3	17		730	And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
01O	3	18		740	thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;
01O	3	19		750	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
01O	3	20		760	And the man called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
01O	3	21		770	And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.
01O	3	22		780	And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever-
01O	3	23		790	therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
01O	3	24		800	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.
01O	4	1		810	And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with [the help of] Jehovah.
01O	4	2		820	And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
01O	4	3		830	And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.
01O	4	4		840	And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his offering:
01O	4	5		850	but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
01O	4	6		860	And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?
01O	4	7		870	If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its desire, but do thou rule over it.
01O	4	8		880	And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.
01O	4	9		890	And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother's keeper?
01O	4	10		900	And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.
01O	4	11		910	And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;
01O	4	12		920	when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.
01O	4	13		930	And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.
01O	4	14		940	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it will come to pass, that whosoever findeth me will slay me.
01O	4	15		950	And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.
01O	4	16		960	And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.
01O	4	17		970	And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.
01O	4	18		980	And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.
01O	4	19		990	And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
01O	4	20		1000	And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.
01O	4	21		1010	And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.
01O	4	22		1020	And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
01O	4	23		1030	And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:
01O	4	24		1040	If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.
01O	4	25		1050	And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth. For, [said she], God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.
01O	4	26		1060	And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of Jehovah.
01O	5	1		1070	This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;
01O	5	2		1080	male and female created he them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.
01O	5	3		1090	And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat [a son] in his own likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth:
01O	5	4		1100	and the days of Adam after he begat Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters.
01O	5	5		1110	And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.
01O	5	6		1120	And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat Enosh:
01O	5	7		1130	and Seth lived after he begat Enosh eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:
01O	5	8		1140	and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.
01O	5	9		1150	And Enosh lived ninety years, and begat Kenan.
01O	5	10		1160	and Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:
01O	5	11		1170	and all the days of Enosh were nine hundred and five years: and he died.
01O	5	12		1180	And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel:
01O	5	13		1190	and Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:
01O	5	14		1200	and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.
01O	5	15		1210	And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:
01O	5	16		1220	And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:
01O	5	17		1230	and all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.
01O	5	18		1240	And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat Enoch:
01O	5	19		1250	and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
01O	5	20		1260	And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.
01O	5	21		1270	And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:
01O	5	22		1280	and Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:
01O	5	23		1290	and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:
01O	5	24		1300	and Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.
01O	5	25		1310	And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech:
01O	5	26		1320	and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	5	27		1330	And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.
01O	5	28		1340	And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:
01O	5	29		1350	and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us in our work and in the toil of our hands, [which cometh] because of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed.
01O	5	30		1360	And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:
01O	5	31		1370	And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.
01O	5	32		1380	And Noah was five hundred years old: And Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01O	6	1		1390	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,
01O	6	2		1400	that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.
01O	6	3		1410	And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.
01O	6	4		1420	The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.
01O	6	5		1430	And Jehovah saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
01O	6	6		1440	And it repented Jehovah that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
01O	6	7		1450	And Jehovah said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
01O	6	8		1460	But Noah found favor in the eyes of Jehovah.
01O	6	9		1470	These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, [and] perfect in his generations: Noah walked with God.
01O	6	10		1480	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01O	6	11		1490	And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.
01O	6	12		1500	And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
01O	6	13		1510	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
01O	6	14		1520	Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
01O	6	15		1530	And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
01O	6	16		1540	A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
01O	6	17		1550	And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die.
01O	6	18		1560	But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.
01O	6	19		1570	And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
01O	6	20		1580	Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
01O	6	21		1590	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
01O	6	22		1600	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
01O	7	1		1610	And Jehovah said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this generation.
01O	7	2		1620	Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven and seven, the male and his female; and of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female:
01O	7	3		1630	of the birds also of the heavens, seven and seven, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
01O	7	4		1640	For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the ground.
01O	7	5		1650	And Noah did according unto all that Jehovah commanded him.
01O	7	6		1660	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
01O	7	7		1670	And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.
01O	7	8		1680	Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground,
01O	7	9		1690	there went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.
01O	7	10		1700	And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
01O	7	11		1710	In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
01O	7	12		1720	And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
01O	7	13		1730	In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;
01O	7	14		1740	they, and every beast after its kind, and all the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.
01O	7	15		1750	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life.
01O	7	16		1760	And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him: and Jehovah shut him in.
01O	7	17		1770	And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
01O	7	18		1780	And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
01O	7	19		1790	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered.
01O	7	20		1800	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.
01O	7	21		1810	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both birds, and cattle, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man:
01O	7	22		1820	all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.
01O	7	23		1830	And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only was left, and they that were with him in the ark.
01O	7	24		1840	And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.
01O	8	1		1850	And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark: and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged;
01O	8	2		1860	the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
01O	8	3		1870	and the waters returned from off the earth continually: and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.
01O	8	4		1880	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
01O	8	5		1890	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen.
01O	8	6		1900	And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:
01O	8	7		1910	and he sent forth a raven, and it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
01O	8	8		1920	And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground;
01O	8	9		1930	but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark; for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: and he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.
01O	8	10		1940	And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark;
01O	8	11		1950	and the dove came in to him at eventide; and, lo, in her mouth an olive-leaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
01O	8	12		1960	And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove; and she returned not again unto him any more.
01O	8	13		1970	And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dried.
01O	8	14		1980	And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.
01O	8	15		1990	And God spake unto Noah, saying,
01O	8	16		2000	Go forth from the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.
01O	8	17		2010	Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds, and cattle, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
01O	8	18		2020	And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him:
01O	8	19		2030	every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatsoever moveth upon the earth, after their families, went forth out of the ark.
01O	8	20		2040	And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt-offerings on the altar.
01O	8	21		2050	And Jehovah smelled the sweet savor; and Jehovah said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more everything living, as I have done.
01O	8	22		2060	While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
01O	9	1		2070	And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
01O	9	2		2080	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; With all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.
01O	9	3		2090	Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; As the green herb have I given you all.
01O	9	4		2100	But flesh with the life thereof, [which is] the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
01O	9	5		2110	And surely your blood, [the blood] of your lives, will I require; At the hand of every beast will I require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, will I require the life of man.
01O	9	6		2120	Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the image of God made he man.
01O	9	7		2130	And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; Bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
01O	9	8		2140	And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,
01O	9	9		2150	And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;
01O	9	10		2160	and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you. Of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
01O	9	11		2170	And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
01O	9	12		2180	And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:
01O	9	13		2190	I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
01O	9	14		2200	And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud,
01O	9	15		2210	and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
01O	9	16		2220	And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
01O	9	17		2230	And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
01O	9	18		2240	And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
01O	9	19		2250	These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.
01O	9	20		2260	And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:
01O	9	21		2270	and he drank of the wine, and was drunken. And he was uncovered within his tent.
01O	9	22		2280	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
01O	9	23		2290	And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
01O	9	24		2300	And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.
01O	9	25		2310	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
01O	9	26		2320	And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
01O	9	27		2330	God enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
01O	9	28		2340	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
01O	9	29		2350	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: And he died.
01O	10	1		2360	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, [namely], of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
01O	10	2		2370	The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
01O	10	3		2380	And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
01O	10	4		2390	And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
01O	10	5		2400	Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
01O	10	6		2410	And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
01O	10	7		2420	And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.
01O	10	8		2430	And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
01O	10	9		2440	He was a mighty hunter before Jehovah: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before Jehovah.
01O	10	10		2450	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
01O	10	11		2460	Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-ir, and Calah,
01O	10	12		2470	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
01O	10	13		2480	And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,
01O	10	14		2490	and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
01O	10	15		2500	And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth,
01O	10	16		2510	and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite,
01O	10	17		2520	and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,
01O	10	18		2530	and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
01O	10	19		2540	And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.
01O	10	20		2550	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
01O	10	21		2560	And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
01O	10	22		2570	The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
01O	10	23		2580	And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
01O	10	24		2590	And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.
01O	10	25		2600	And unto Eber were born two sons: The name of the one was Peleg. For in his days was the earth divided. And his brother's name was Joktan.
01O	10	26		2610	And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,
01O	10	27		2620	and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,
01O	10	28		2630	and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,
01O	10	29		2640	and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
01O	10	30		2650	And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
01O	10	31		2660	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
01O	10	32		2670	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
01O	11	1		2680	And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
01O	11	2		2690	And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
01O	11	3		2700	And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
01O	11	4		2710	And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
01O	11	5		2720	And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
01O	11	6		2730	And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
01O	11	7		2740	Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
01O	11	8		2750	So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
01O	11	9		2760	Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
01O	11	10		2770	These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.
01O	11	11		2780	and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	12		2790	And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.
01O	11	13		2800	and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	14		2810	And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:
01O	11	15		2820	and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	16		2830	And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:
01O	11	17		2840	and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	18		2850	And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:
01O	11	19		2860	and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	20		2870	And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:
01O	11	21		2880	and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	22		2890	And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:
01O	11	23		2900	and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	24		2910	And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:
01O	11	25		2920	and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
01O	11	26		2930	And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
01O	11	27		2940	Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.
01O	11	28		2950	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
01O	11	29		2960	And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
01O	11	30		2970	And Sarai was barren; She had no child.
01O	11	31		2980	And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
01O	11	32		2990	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
01O	12	1		3000	Now Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will show thee:
01O	12	2		3010	and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make they name great; and be thou a blessing;
01O	12	3		3020	and I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse: and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
01O	12	4		3030	So Abram went, as Jehovah had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.
01O	12	5		3040	And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
01O	12	6		3050	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the oak of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
01O	12	7		3060	And Jehovah appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto Jehovah, who appeared unto him.
01O	12	8		3070	And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto Jehovah, and called upon the name of Jehovah.
01O	12	9		3080	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.
01O	12	10		3090	And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.
01O	12	11		3100	And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:
01O	12	12		3110	and it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
01O	12	13		3120	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.
01O	12	14		3130	And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
01O	12	15		3140	And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.
01O	12	16		3150	And he dealt well with Abram for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.
01O	12	17		3160	And Jehovah plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
01O	12	18		3170	And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
01O	12	19		3180	why saidst thou, She is my sister, so that I took her to be my wife? now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.
01O	12	20		3190	And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him: and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.
01O	13	1		3200	And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.
01O	13	2		3210	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
01O	13	3		3220	And he went on his journeys from the South even to Beth-el, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Beth-el and Ai,
01O	13	4		3230	unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of Jehovah.
01O	13	5		3240	And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.
01O	13	6		3250	And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.
01O	13	7		3260	And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's cattle and the herdsmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
01O	13	8		3270	And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, and between my herdsmen and thy herdsmen; for we are brethren.
01O	13	9		3280	Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If [thou wilt take] the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if [thou take] the right hand, then I will go to the left.
01O	13	10		3290	And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the Plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Jehovah, like the land of Egypt, as thou goest unto Zoar.
01O	13	11		3300	So Lot chose him all the Plain of the Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.
01O	13	12		3310	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the Plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.
01O	13	13		3320	Now the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against Jehovah exceedingly.
01O	13	14		3330	And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward and southward and eastward and westward:
01O	13	15		3340	for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
01O	13	16		3350	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: So that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then may thy seed also be numbered.
01O	13	17		3360	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for unto thee will I give it.
01O	13	18		3370	And Abram moved his tent, and came and dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built there an altar unto Jehovah.
01O	14	1		3380	And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,
01O	14	2		3390	that they made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).
01O	14	3		3400	All these joined together in the vale of Siddim (the same is the Salt Sea).
01O	14	4		3410	Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
01O	14	5		3420	And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim,
01O	14	6		3430	and the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by the wilderness.
01O	14	7		3440	And they returned, and came to En-mishpat (the same is Kadesh), and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites, that dwelt in Hazazon-tamar.
01O	14	8		3450	And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar); and they set the battle in array against them in the vale of Siddim;
01O	14	9		3460	against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings against the five.
01O	14	10		3470	Now the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain.
01O	14	11		3480	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.
01O	14	12		3490	And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed.
01O	14	13		3500	And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the Hebrew: now he dwelt by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
01O	14	14		3510	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he led forth his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued as far as Dan.
01O	14	15		3520	And he divided himself against them by night, he and his servants, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
01O	14	16		3530	And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the people.
01O	14	17		3540	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him, at the vale of Shaveh (the same is the King's Vale).
01O	14	18		3550	And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was priest of God Most High.
01O	14	19		3560	And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth:
01O	14	20		3570	and blessed be God Most High, who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him a tenth of all.
01O	14	21		3580	And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself.
01O	14	22		3590	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,
01O	14	23		3600	that I will not take a thread nor a shoe-latchet nor aught that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:
01O	14	24		3610	save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men that went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre. Let them take their portion.
01O	15	1		3620	After these things the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, [and] thy exceeding great reward.
01O	15	2		3630	And Abram said, O Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?
01O	15	3		3640	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
01O	15	4		3650	And, behold, the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; But he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
01O	15	5		3660	And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
01O	15	6		3670	And he believed in Jehovah; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
01O	15	7		3680	And he said unto him, I am Jehovah that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
01O	15	8		3690	And he said, O Lord Jehovah, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
01O	15	9		3700	And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
01O	15	10		3710	And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not.
01O	15	11		3720	And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
01O	15	12		3730	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
01O	15	13		3740	And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
01O	15	14		3750	and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
01O	15	15		3760	But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
01O	15	16		3770	And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again; for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
01O	15	17		3780	And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
01O	15	18		3790	In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
01O	15	19		3800	the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,
01O	15	20		3810	and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,
01O	15	21		3820	and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
01O	16	1		3830	Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children: and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
01O	16	2		3840	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, Jehovah hath restrained me from bearing; go in, I pray thee, unto my handmaid; it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.
01O	16	3		3850	And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.
01O	16	4		3860	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
01O	16	5		3870	And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I gave my handmaid into they bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: Jehovah judge between me and thee.
01O	16	6		3880	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her that which is good in thine eyes. And Sarai dealt hardly with her, and she fled from her face.
01O	16	7		3890	And the angel of Jehovah found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.
01O	16	8		3900	And he said, Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, whence camest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai.
01O	16	9		3910	And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Return to thy mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.
01O	16	10		3920	And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, I will greatly multiply thy seed, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.
01O	16	11		3930	And the angel of Jehovah said unto her, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because Jehovah hath heard thy affliction.
01O	16	12		3940	And he shall be [as] a wild ass among men; his hand [shall be] against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell over against all his brethren.
01O	16	13		3950	And she called the name of Jehovah that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth: for she said, Have I even here looked after him that seeth me?
01O	16	14		3960	Wherefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi; behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
01O	16	15		3970	And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called the name of his son, whom Hagar bare, Ishmael.
01O	16	16		3980	And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram.
01O	17	1		3990	And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, Jehovah appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God Almighty; walk before me, and be thou perfect.
01O	17	2		4000	And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.
01O	17	3		4010	And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,
01O	17	4		4020	As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be the father of a multitude of nations.
01O	17	5		4030	Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for the father of a multitude of nations have I made thee.
01O	17	6		4040	And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
01O	17	7		4050	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
01O	17	8		4060	And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.
01O	17	9		4070	And God said unto Abraham, And as for thee, thou shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee throughout their generations.
01O	17	10		4080	This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.
01O	17	11		4090	And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt me and you.
01O	17	12		4100	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner that is not of thy seed.
01O	17	13		4110	He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
01O	17	14		4120	And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.
01O	17	15		4130	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
01O	17	16		4140	And I will bless her, and moreover I will give thee a son of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be [a mother of] nations; kings of peoples shall be of her.
01O	17	17		4150	Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?
01O	17	18		4160	And Abraham said unto God, Oh that Ishmael might live before thee!
01O	17	19		4170	And God said, Nay, but Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant for his seed after him.
01O	17	20		4180	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.
01O	17	21		4190	But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
01O	17	22		4200	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
01O	17	23		4210	And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.
01O	17	24		4220	And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
01O	17	25		4230	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
01O	17	26		4240	In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son.
01O	17	27		4250	And all the men of his house, those born in the house, and those bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.
01O	18	1		4260	And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
01O	18	2		4270	and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,
01O	18	3		4280	and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:
01O	18	4		4290	let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:
01O	18	5		4300	and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
01O	18	6		4310	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.
01O	18	7		4320	And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.
01O	18	8		4330	And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
01O	18	9		4340	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
01O	18	10		4350	And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
01O	18	11		4360	Now Abraham and Sarah were old, [and] well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
01O	18	12		4370	And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
01O	18	13		4380	And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?
01O	18	14		4390	Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.
01O	18	15		4400	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
01O	18	16		4410	And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
01O	18	17		4420	And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;
01O	18	18		4430	seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?
01O	18	19		4440	For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.
01O	18	20		4450	And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;
01O	18	21		4460	I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
01O	18	22		4470	And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.
01O	18	23		4480	And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?
01O	18	24		4490	Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?
01O	18	25		4500	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
01O	18	26		4510	And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.
01O	18	27		4520	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:
01O	18	28		4530	peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.
01O	18	29		4540	And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.
01O	18	30		4550	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
01O	18	31		4560	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.
01O	18	32		4570	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.
01O	18	33		4580	And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.
01O	19	1		4590	And the two angels came to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth;
01O	19	2		4600	and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn aside, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
01O	19	3		4610	And he urged them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
01O	19	4		4620	But before they lay down, the men of the city, [even] the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both young and old, all the people from every quarter;
01O	19	5		4630	and they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men that came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
01O	19	6		4640	And Lot went out unto them to the door, and shut the door after him.
01O	19	7		4650	And he said, I pray you, my brethren, do not so wickedly.
01O	19	8		4660	Behold now, I have two daughters that have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing, forasmuch as they are come under the shadow of my roof.
01O	19	9		4670	And they said, Stand back. And they said, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew near to break the door.
01O	19	10		4680	But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
01O	19	11		4690	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
01O	19	12		4700	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place:
01O	19	13		4710	for we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxed great before Jehovah: and Jehovah hath sent us to destroy it.
01O	19	14		4720	And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons-in-law, who married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for Jehovah will destroy the city. But he seemed unto his sons-in-law as one that mocked.
01O	19	15		4730	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are here, lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
01O	19	16		4740	But he lingered; and the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters, Jehovah being merciful unto him; and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
01O	19	17		4750	And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the Plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
01O	19	18		4760	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lord:
01O	19	19		4770	behold now, thy servant hath found favor in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy lovingkindness, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest evil overtake me, and I die:
01O	19	20		4780	behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one. Oh let me escape thither (is it not a little one?), and my soul shall live.
01O	19	21		4790	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken.
01O	19	22		4800	Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
01O	19	23		4810	The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot came unto Zoar.
01O	19	24		4820	Then Jehovah rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Jehovah out of heaven;
01O	19	25		4830	and he overthrew those cities, and all the Plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
01O	19	26		4840	But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
01O	19	27		4850	And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before Jehovah:
01O	19	28		4860	and he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
01O	19	29		4870	And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the Plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.
01O	19	30		4880	And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
01O	19	31		4890	And the first-born said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
01O	19	32		4900	come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
01O	19	33		4910	And they made their father drink wine that night: and the first-born went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
01O	19	34		4920	And it came to pass on the morrow, that the first-born said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
01O	19	35		4930	And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
01O	19	36		4940	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
01O	19	37		4950	And the first-born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
01O	19	38		4960	And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
01O	20	1		4970	And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the land of the South, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur. And he sojourned in Gerar.
01O	20	2		4980	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.
01O	20	3		4990	But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, because of the woman whom thou hast taken. For she is a man's wife.
01O	20	4		5000	Now Abimelech had not come near her. And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even a righteous nation?
01O	20	5		5010	Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother. In the integrity of my heart and the innocency of my hands have I done this.
01O	20	6		5020	And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the integrity of thy heart thou has done this, and I also withheld thee from sinning against me. Therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
01O	20	7		5030	Now therefore restore the man's wife. For he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
01O	20	8		5040	And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ear. And the men were sore afraid.
01O	20	9		5050	Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And wherein have I sinned against thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
01O	20	10		5060	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
01O	20	11		5070	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place. And they will slay me for my wife's sake.
01O	20	12		5080	And moreover she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife:
01O	20	13		5090	and it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show unto me. At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
01O	20	14		5100	And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and men-servants and women-servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.
01O	20	15		5110	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee. Dwell where it pleaseth thee.
01O	20	16		5120	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver. Behold, it is for thee a covering of the eyes to all that are with thee. And in respect of all thou art righted.
01O	20	17		5130	And Abraham prayed unto God. And God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants. And they bare children.
01O	20	18		5140	For Jehovah had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
01O	21	1		5150	And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
01O	21	2		5160	And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
01O	21	3		5170	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.
01O	21	4		5180	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.
01O	21	5		5190	And Abraham was a hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.
01O	21	6		5200	And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh. Every one that heareth will laugh with me.
01O	21	7		5210	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? For I have borne him a son in his old age.
01O	21	8		5220	And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.
01O	21	9		5230	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.
01O	21	10		5240	Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son. For the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
01O	21	11		5250	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account of his son.
01O	21	12		5260	And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid. In all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
01O	21	13		5270	And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
01O	21	14		5280	And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and [gave her] the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
01O	21	15		5290	And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
01O	21	16		5300	And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot. For she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
01O	21	17		5310	And God heard the voice of the lad. And the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not. For God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
01O	21	18		5320	Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand. For I will make him a great nation.
01O	21	19		5330	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. And she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
01O	21	20		5340	And God was with the lad, and he grew. And he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
01O	21	21		5350	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
01O	21	22		5360	And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.
01O	21	23		5370	Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son. But according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
01O	21	24		5380	And Abraham said, I will swear.
01O	21	25		5390	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.
01O	21	26		5400	And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing. Neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.
01O	21	27		5410	And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech. And they two made a covenant.
01O	21	28		5420	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
01O	21	29		5430	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
01O	21	30		5440	And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
01O	21	31		5450	Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba. Because there they sware both of them.
01O	21	32		5460	So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
01O	21	33		5470	And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Everlasting God.
01O	21	34		5480	And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
01O	22	1		5490	And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham. And he said, Here am I.
01O	22	2		5500	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah. And offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
01O	22	3		5510	And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son. And he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.
01O	22	4		5520	On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
01O	22	5		5530	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.
01O	22	6		5540	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son. And he took in his hand the fire and the knife. And they went both of them together.
01O	22	7		5550	And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood. But where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?
01O	22	8		5560	And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son. So they went both of them together.
01O	22	9		5570	And they came to the place which God had told him of. And Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
01O	22	10		5580	And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
01O	22	11		5590	And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham. And he said, Here I am.
01O	22	12		5600	And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him. For now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.
01O	22	13		5610	And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind [him] a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
01O	22	14		5620	And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh. As it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.
01O	22	15		5630	And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,
01O	22	16		5640	and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,
01O	22	17		5650	that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore. And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies.
01O	22	18		5660	And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Because thou hast obeyed my voice.
01O	22	19		5670	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.
01O	22	20		5680	And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto they brother Nahor.
01O	22	21		5690	Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram.
01O	22	22		5700	And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
01O	22	23		5710	And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham's brother.
01O	22	24		5720	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
01O	23	1		5730	And the life of Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years. These were the years of the life of Sarah.
01O	23	2		5740	And Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.
01O	23	3		5750	And Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spake unto the children of Heth, saying,
01O	23	4		5760	I am a stranger and a sojourner with you. Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
01O	23	5		5770	And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
01O	23	6		5780	Hear us, my lord. Thou art a prince of God among us. In the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead. None of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.
01O	23	7		5790	And Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.
01O	23	8		5800	And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,
01O	23	9		5810	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in the midst of you for a possession of a burying-place.
01O	23	10		5820	Now Ephron was sitting in the midst of the children of Heth. And Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
01O	23	11		5830	Nay, my lord, hear me. The field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, I give it thee. In the presence of the children of my people give I it thee. Bury thy dead.
01O	23	12		5840	And Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.
01O	23	13		5850	And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt, I pray thee, hear me. I will give the price of the field. Take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
01O	23	14		5860	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
01O	23	15		5870	My lord, hearken unto me. A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that betwixt me and thee? Bury therefore thy dead.
01O	23	16		5880	And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron. And Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the children of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current [money] with the merchant.
01O	23	17		5890	So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the border thereof round about, were made sure
01O	23	18		5900	unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
01O	23	19		5910	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (the same is Hebron), in the land of Canaan.
01O	23	20		5920	And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a burying-place by the children of Heth.
01O	24	1		5930	And Abraham was old, [and] well stricken in age. And Jehovah had blessed Abraham in all things.
01O	24	2		5940	And Abraham said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh.
01O	24	3		5950	And I will make thee swear by Jehovah, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell.
01O	24	4		5960	But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Isaac.
01O	24	5		5970	And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. Must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest?
01O	24	6		5980	And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
01O	24	7		5990	Jehovah, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spake unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land. He will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
01O	24	8		6000	And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath. Only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.
01O	24	9		6010	And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.
01O	24	10		6020	And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master's in his hand. And he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
01O	24	11		6030	And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
01O	24	12		6040	And he said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Abraham.
01O	24	13		6050	Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.
01O	24	14		6060	And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink. And she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac. And thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master.
01O	24	15		6070	And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
01O	24	16		6080	And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her. And she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
01O	24	17		6090	And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.
01O	24	18		6100	And she said, Drink, my lord. And she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
01O	24	19		6110	And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
01O	24	20		6120	And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
01O	24	21		6130	And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether Jehovah had made his journey prosperous or not.
01O	24	22		6140	And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,
01O	24	23		6150	and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee. Is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?
01O	24	24		6160	And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.
01O	24	25		6170	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
01O	24	26		6180	And the man bowed his head, and worshipped Jehovah.
01O	24	27		6190	And he said, Blessed be Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master. As for me, Jehovah hath led me in the way to the house of my master's brethren.
01O	24	28		6200	And the damsel ran, and told her mother's house according to these words.
01O	24	29		6210	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.
01O	24	30		6220	And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me. That he came unto the man. And, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.
01O	24	31		6230	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of Jehovah. Wherefore standest thou without? For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
01O	24	32		6240	And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels. And he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.
01O	24	33		6250	And there was set food before him to eat. But he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
01O	24	34		6260	And he said, I am Abraham's servant.
01O	24	35		6270	And Jehovah hath blessed my master greatly. And he is become great. And he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses.
01O	24	36		6280	And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old. And unto him hath he given all that he hath.
01O	24	37		6290	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell.
01O	24	38		6300	But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
01O	24	39		6310	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
01O	24	40		6320	And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way. And thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house.
01O	24	41		6330	Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred. And if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
01O	24	42		6340	And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go.
01O	24	43		6350	Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water. And let it come to pass, that the maiden that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink.
01O	24	44		6360	And she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels. Let the same be the woman whom Jehovah hath appointed for my master's son.
01O	24	45		6370	And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder. And she went down unto the fountain, and drew. And I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
01O	24	46		6380	And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also. So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
01O	24	47		6390	And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.
01O	24	48		6400	And I bowed my head, and worshipped Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.
01O	24	49		6410	And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. And if not, tell me. That I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
01O	24	50		6420	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from Jehovah. We cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
01O	24	51		6430	Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as Jehovah hath spoken.
01O	24	52		6440	And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto Jehovah.
01O	24	53		6450	And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah. He gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
01O	24	54		6460	And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night. And they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
01O	24	55		6470	And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us [a few] days, at the least ten. After that she shall go.
01O	24	56		6480	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing Jehovah hath prospered my way. Send me away that I may go to my master.
01O	24	57		6490	And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
01O	24	58		6500	And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
01O	24	59		6510	And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his men.
01O	24	60		6520	And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou [the mother] of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.
01O	24	61		6530	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man. And the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
01O	24	62		6540	And Isaac came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi. For he dwelt in the land of the South.
01O	24	63		6550	And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
01O	24	64		6560	And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she alighted from the camel.
01O	24	65		6570	And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master. And she took her veil, and covered herself.
01O	24	66		6580	And the servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
01O	24	67		6590	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife. And he loved her. And Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
01O	25	1		6600	And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.
01O	25	2		6610	And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
01O	25	3		6620	And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
01O	25	4		6630	And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
01O	25	5		6640	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
01O	25	6		6650	But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. And he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
01O	25	7		6660	And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.
01O	25	8		6670	And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full [of years], and was gathered to his people.
01O	25	9		6680	And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre.
01O	25	10		6690	The field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. There was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
01O	25	11		6700	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son. And Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahai-roi.
01O	25	12		6710	Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham.
01O	25	13		6720	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth, and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
01O	25	14		6730	and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
01O	25	15		6740	Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
01O	25	16		6750	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments. Twelve princes according to their nations.
01O	25	17		6760	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years. And he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people.
01O	25	18		6770	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria. He abode over against all his brethren.
01O	25	19		6780	And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham begat Isaac.
01O	25	20		6790	And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.
01O	25	21		6800	And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren. And Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
01O	25	22		6810	And the children struggled together within her. And she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.
01O	25	23		6820	And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. And the one people shall be stronger than the other people. And the elder shall serve the younger.
01O	25	24		6830	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
01O	25	25		6840	And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment. And they called his name Esau.
01O	25	26		6850	And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. And his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
01O	25	27		6860	And the boys grew. And Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field. And Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.
01O	25	28		6870	Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison. And Rebekah loved Jacob.
01O	25	29		6880	And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.
01O	25	30		6890	And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red [pottage]. For I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.
01O	25	31		6900	And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.
01O	25	32		6910	And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die. And what profit shall the birthright do to me?
01O	25	33		6920	And Jacob said, Swear to me first. And he sware unto him. And he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
01O	25	34		6930	And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. And he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.
01O	26	1		6940	And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
01O	26	2		6950	And Jehovah appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt. Dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of.
01O	26	3		6960	Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee. For unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father.
01O	26	4		6970	And I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.
01O	26	5		6980	Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
01O	26	6		6990	And Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
01O	26	7		7000	And the men of the place asked him of his wife. And he said, She is my sister. For he feared to say, My wife. Lest, [said he], the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah. Because she was fair to look upon.
01O	26	8		7010	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
01O	26	9		7020	And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife. And how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
01O	26	10		7030	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
01O	26	11		7040	And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
01O	26	12		7050	And Isaac sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold. And Jehovah blessed him.
01O	26	13		7060	And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great.
01O	26	14		7070	And he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household. And the Philistines envied him.
01O	26	15		7080	Now all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
01O	26	16		7090	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us. For thou art much mightier than we.
01O	26	17		7100	And Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
01O	26	18		7110	And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father. For the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham. And he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
01O	26	19		7120	And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
01O	26	20		7130	And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
01O	26	21		7140	And they digged another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name of it Sitnah.
01O	26	22		7150	And he removed from thence, and digged another well. And for that they strove not. And he called the name of it Rehoboth. And he said, For now Jehovah hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
01O	26	23		7160	And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
01O	26	24		7170	And Jehovah appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
01O	26	25		7180	And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of Jehovah, and pitched his tent there. And there Isaac's servants digged a well.
01O	26	26		7190	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.
01O	26	27		7200	And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
01O	26	28		7210	And they said, We saw plainly that Jehovah was with thee. And we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee,
01O	26	29		7220	that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace. Thou art now the blessed of Jehovah.
01O	26	30		7230	And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
01O	26	31		7240	And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another. And Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
01O	26	32		7250	And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
01O	26	33		7260	And he called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
01O	26	34		7270	And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite.
01O	26	35		7280	And they were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
01O	27	1		7290	And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son. And he said unto him, Here am I.
01O	27	2		7300	And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death.
01O	27	3		7310	Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me venison.
01O	27	4		7320	And make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat. That my soul may bless thee before I die.
01O	27	5		7330	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.
01O	27	6		7340	And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,
01O	27	7		7350	Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat, and bless thee before Jehovah before my death.
01O	27	8		7360	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee.
01O	27	9		7370	Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats. And I will make them savory food for thy father, such as he loveth.
01O	27	10		7380	And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless thee before his death.
01O	27	11		7390	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.
01O	27	12		7400	My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver. And I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.
01O	27	13		7410	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.
01O	27	14		7420	And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother. And his mother made savory food, such as his father loved.
01O	27	15		7430	And Rebekah took the goodly garments of Esau her elder son, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.
01O	27	16		7440	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.
01O	27	17		7450	And she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
01O	27	18		7460	And he came unto his father, and said, My father. And he said, Here am I. Who art thou, my son?
01O	27	19		7470	And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
01O	27	20		7480	And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God sent me good speed.
01O	27	21		7490	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
01O	27	22		7500	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father. And he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
01O	27	23		7510	And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him.
01O	27	24		7520	And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
01O	27	25		7530	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat. And he brought him wine, and he drank.
01O	27	26		7540	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.
01O	27	27		7550	And he came near, and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son Is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed.
01O	27	28		7560	And God five thee of the dew of heaven, And of the fatness of the earth, And plenty of grain and new wine.
01O	27	29		7570	Let peoples serve thee, And nations bow down to thee. Be lord over thy brethren, And let thy mother's sons bow down to thee. Cursed be every one that curseth thee, And blessed be every one that blesseth thee.
01O	27	30		7580	And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
01O	27	31		7590	And he also made savory food, and brought it unto his father. And he said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.
01O	27	32		7600	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born, Esau.
01O	27	33		7610	And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who then is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? Yea, [and] he shall be blessed.
01O	27	34		7620	When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
01O	27	35		7630	And he said, Thy brother came with guile, and hath taken away thy blessing.
01O	27	36		7640	And he said, Is not he rightly name Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two time. He took away my birthright. And, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
01O	27	37		7650	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants. And with grain and new wine have I sustained him. And what then shall I do for thee, my son?
01O	27	38		7660	And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.
01O	27	39		7670	And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, And of the dew of heaven from above.
01O	27	40		7680	And by thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother. And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt break loose, That thou shalt shake his yoke from off thy neck.
01O	27	41		7690	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand. Then will I slay my brother Jacob.
01O	27	42		7700	And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah. And she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, [purposing] to kill thee.
01O	27	43		7710	Now therefore, my son, obey my voice. And arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran.
01O	27	44		7720	And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away.
01O	27	45		7730	Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him. Then I will send, and fetch thee from thence. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?
01O	27	46		7740	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?
01O	28	1		7750	And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
01O	28	2		7760	Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's father. And take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.
01O	28	3		7770	And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that thou mayest be a company of peoples.
01O	28	4		7780	And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee. That thou mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham.
01O	28	5		7790	And Isaac sent away Jacob. And he went to Paddan-aram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.
01O	28	6		7800	Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from thence. And that as he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
01O	28	7		7810	And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone to Paddan-aram.
01O	28	8		7820	And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac his father.
01O	28	9		7830	And Esau went unto Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.
01O	28	10		7840	And Jacob went out from Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.
01O	28	11		7850	And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set. And he took one of the stones of the place, and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.
01O	28	12		7860	And he dreamed. And behold, a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
01O	28	13		7870	And, behold, Jehovah stood above it, and said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac. The land whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed.
01O	28	14		7880	And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south. And in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
01O	28	15		7890	And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee, whithersoever thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land. For I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
01O	28	16		7900	And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely Jehovah is in this place. And I knew it not.
01O	28	17		7910	And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
01O	28	18		7920	And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it.
01O	28	19		7930	And he called the name of that place Beth-el. But the name of the city was Luz at the first.
01O	28	20		7940	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
01O	28	21		7950	so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Jehovah will be my God,
01O	28	22		7960	then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be God's house. And of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee.
01O	29	1		7970	Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the children of the east.
01O	29	2		7980	And he looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, lo, three flocks of sheep lying there by it. For out of that well they watered the flocks. And the stone upon the well's mouth was great.
01O	29	3		7990	And thither were all the flocks gathered. And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again upon the well's mouth in its place.
01O	29	4		8000	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we.
01O	29	5		8010	And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
01O	29	6		8020	And he said unto them, Is it well with him? And they said, It is well. And, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.
01O	29	7		8030	And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together. Water ye the sheep, and go and feed them.
01O	29	8		8040	And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth. Then we water the sheep.
01O	29	9		8050	While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep. For she kept them.
01O	29	10		8060	And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
01O	29	11		8070	And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.
01O	29	12		8080	And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son. And she ran and told her father.
01O	29	13		8090	And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
01O	29	14		8100	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
01O	29	15		8110	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?
01O	29	16		8120	And Laban had two daughters. The name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
01O	29	17		8130	And Leah's eyes were tender. But Rachel was beautiful and well favored.
01O	29	18		8140	And Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
01O	29	19		8150	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man. Abide with me.
01O	29	20		8160	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
01O	29	21		8170	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
01O	29	22		8180	And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.
01O	29	23		8190	And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him. And he went in unto her.
01O	29	24		8200	And Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.
01O	29	25		8210	And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?
01O	29	26		8220	And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the first-born.
01O	29	27		8230	Fulfil the week of this one, and we will give thee the other also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.
01O	29	28		8240	And jacob did so, and fulfilled her week. And he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife.
01O	29	29		8250	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her handmaid.
01O	29	30		8260	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.
01O	29	31		8270	And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb. But Rachel was barren.
01O	29	32		8280	And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben. For she said, Because Jehovah hath looked upon my affliction. For now my husband will love me.
01O	29	33		8290	And she conceived again, and bare a son: and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I am hated, he hath therefore given me this [son] also. And she called his name Simeon.
01O	29	34		8300	And she conceived again, and bare a son. And said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have borne him three sons. Therefore was his name called Levi.
01O	29	35		8310	And she conceived again, and bare a son. And she said, This time will I praise Jehovah. Therefore she called his name Judah. And she left off bearing.
01O	30	1		8320	And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and she said unto Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.
01O	30	2		8330	And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
01O	30	3		8340	And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; that she may bear upon my knees, and I also may obtain children by her.
01O	30	4		8350	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went in unto her.
01O	30	5		8360	And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.
01O	30	6		8370	And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name Dan.
01O	30	7		8380	And Bilhah Rachel's handmaid conceived again, and bare Jacob a second son.
01O	30	8		8390	And Rachel said, With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.
01O	30	9		8400	When Leah saw that she had left off bearing, she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob to wife.
01O	30	10		8410	And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son.
01O	30	11		8420	And Leah said, Fortunate! and she called his name Gad.
01O	30	12		8430	And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a second son.
01O	30	13		8440	And Leah said, Happy am I! for the daughters will call me happy: and she called his name Asher.
01O	30	14		8450	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes.
01O	30	15		8460	And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken away my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son's mandrakes.
01O	30	16		8470	And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for I have surely hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
01O	30	17		8480	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob a fifth son.
01O	30	18		8490	And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.
01O	30	19		8500	And Leah conceived again, and bare a sixth son to Jacob.
01O	30	20		8510	And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.
01O	30	21		8520	And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.
01O	30	22		8530	And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb.
01O	30	23		8540	And she conceived, and bare a son: and said, God hath taken away my reproach:
01O	30	24		8550	and she called his name Joseph, saying, Jehovah add to me another son.
01O	30	25		8560	And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country.
01O	30	26		8570	Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service wherewith I have served thee.
01O	30	27		8580	And Laban said unto him, If now I have found favor in thine eyes, [tarry]: [for] I have divined that Jehovah hath blessed me for thy sake.
01O	30	28		8590	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
01O	30	29		8600	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle have fared with me.
01O	30	30		8610	For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it hath increased unto a multitude; and Jehovah hath blessed thee whithersoever I turned: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also?
01O	30	31		8620	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me aught: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed thy flock and keep it.
01O	30	32		8630	I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and [of such] shall be my hire.
01O	30	33		8640	So shall my righteousness answer for me hereafter, when thou shalt come concerning my hire that is before thee: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the sheep, that [if found] with me, shall be counted stolen.
01O	30	34		8650	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
01O	30	35		8660	And he removed that day the he-goats that were ringstreaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted, every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons;
01O	30	36		8670	and he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.
01O	30	37		8680	And Jacob took him rods of fresh poplar, and of the almond and of the plane-tree. And peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.
01O	30	38		8690	And he set the rods which he had peeled over against the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink; and they conceived when they came to drink.
01O	30	39		8700	And the flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought forth ringstreaked, speckled, and spotted.
01O	30	40		8710	And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstreaked and all the black in the flock of Laban: and he put his own droves apart, and put them not unto Laban's flock.
01O	30	41		8720	And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger of the flock did conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
01O	30	42		8730	but when the flock were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
01O	30	43		8740	And the man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks, and maid-servants and men-servants, and camels and asses.
01O	31	1		8750	And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was our father's hath he gotten all this glory.
01O	31	2		8760	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
01O	31	3		8770	And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
01O	31	4		8780	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock,
01O	31	5		8790	and said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the God of my father hath been with me.
01O	31	6		8800	And ye know that will all my power I have served your father.
01O	31	7		8810	And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.
01O	31	8		8820	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.
01O	31	9		8830	Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
01O	31	10		8840	And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
01O	31	11		8850	And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob: and I said, Here am I.
01O	31	12		8860	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
01O	31	13		8870	I am the God of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.
01O	31	14		8880	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?
01O	31	15		8890	Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.
01O	31	16		8900	For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath said unto thee, do.
01O	31	17		8910	Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
01O	31	18		8920	and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father unto the land of Canaan.
01O	31	19		8930	Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's.
01O	31	20		8940	And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
01O	31	21		8950	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
01O	31	22		8960	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.
01O	31	23		8970	And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days' journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
01O	31	24		8980	And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
01O	31	25		8990	And Laban came up with Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
01O	31	26		9000	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?
01O	31	27		9010	Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp;
01O	31	28		9020	and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
01O	31	29		9030	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
01O	31	30		9040	And now, [though] thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father's house, [yet] wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?
01O	31	31		9050	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
01O	31	32		9060	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
01O	31	33		9070	And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.
01O	31	34		9080	Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
01O	31	35		9090	And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.
01O	31	36		9100	And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?
01O	31	37		9110	Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.
01O	31	38		9120	These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
01O	31	39		9130	That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
01O	31	40		9140	Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
01O	31	41		9150	These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
01O	31	42		9160	Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
01O	31	43		9170	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne?
01O	31	44		9180	And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
01O	31	45		9190	And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
01O	31	46		9200	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
01O	31	47		9210	And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Jacob called it Galeed.
01O	31	48		9220	And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed:
01O	31	49		9230	and Mizpah, for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
01O	31	50		9240	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness betwixt me and thee.
01O	31	51		9250	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.
01O	31	52		9260	This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
01O	31	53		9270	The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the Fear of his father Isaac.
01O	31	54		9280	And Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
01O	31	55		9290	And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed and returned unto his place.
01O	32	1		9300	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
01O	32	2		9310	And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
01O	32	3		9320	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
01O	32	4		9330	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:
01O	32	5		9340	and I have oxen, and asses, [and] flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.
01O	32	6		9350	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
01O	32	7		9360	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;
01O	32	8		9370	and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
01O	32	9		9380	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:
01O	32	10		9390	I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.
01O	32	11		9400	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
01O	32	12		9410	And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
01O	32	13		9420	And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:
01O	32	14		9430	two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
01O	32	15		9440	thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
01O	32	16		9450	And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
01O	32	17		9460	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?
01O	32	18		9470	then thou shalt say [They are] thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.
01O	32	19		9480	And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;
01O	32	20		9490	and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.
01O	32	21		9500	So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.
01O	32	22		9510	And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
01O	32	23		9520	And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
01O	32	24		9530	And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
01O	32	25		9540	And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
01O	32	26		9550	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
01O	32	27		9560	And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
01O	32	28		9570	And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
01O	32	29		9580	And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
01O	32	30		9590	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, [said he], I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.
01O	32	31		9600	And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.
01O	32	32		9610	Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.
01O	33	1		9620	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
01O	33	2		9630	And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.
01O	33	3		9640	And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
01O	33	4		9650	And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
01O	33	5		9660	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy servant.
01O	33	6		9670	Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
01O	33	7		9680	And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
01O	33	8		9690	And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
01O	33	9		9700	And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.
01O	33	10		9710	And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
01O	33	11		9720	Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.
01O	33	12		9730	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
01O	33	13		9740	And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
01O	33	14		9750	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
01O	33	15		9760	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
01O	33	16		9770	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
01O	33	17		9780	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
01O	33	18		9790	And Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.
01O	33	19		9800	And he bought the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred pieces of money.
01O	33	20		9810	And he erected there an altar, and called it El-elohe-israel.
01O	34	1		9820	And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
01O	34	2		9830	And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; And he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
01O	34	3		9840	And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.
01O	34	4		9850	And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
01O	34	5		9860	Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his peace until they came.
01O	34	6		9870	And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune with him.
01O	34	7		9880	And the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
01O	34	8		9890	And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.
01O	34	9		9900	And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
01O	34	10		9910	And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
01O	34	11		9920	And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
01O	34	12		9930	Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
01O	34	13		9940	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spake, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,
01O	34	14		9950	and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.
01O	34	15		9960	Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;
01O	34	16		9970	then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
01O	34	17		9980	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
01O	34	18		9990	And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.
01O	34	19		10000	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.
01O	34	20		10010	And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,
01O	34	21		10020	These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
01O	34	22		10030	Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
01O	34	23		10040	Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
01O	34	24		10050	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
01O	34	25		10060	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.
01O	34	26		10070	And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went forth.
01O	34	27		10080	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
01O	34	28		10090	They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field;
01O	34	29		10100	and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.
01O	34	30		10110	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
01O	34	31		10120	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
01O	35	1		10130	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.
01O	35	2		10140	Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:
01O	35	3		10150	and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.
01O	35	4		10160	And they gave unto Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
01O	35	5		10170	And they journeyed: and a terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
01O	35	6		10180	So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.
01O	35	7		10190	And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el; because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.
01O	35	8		10200	And Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.
01O	35	9		10210	And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.
01O	35	10		10220	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.
01O	35	11		10230	And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
01O	35	12		10240	and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
01O	35	13		10250	And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.
01O	35	14		10260	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink-offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.
01O	35	15		10270	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.
01O	35	16		10280	And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some distance to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.
01O	35	17		10290	And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.
01O	35	18		10300	And it came to pass, as her soul was departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.
01O	35	19		10310	And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
01O	35	20		10320	And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day.
01O	35	21		10330	And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.
01O	35	22		10340	And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
01O	35	23		10350	The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob's first-born, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun;
01O	35	24		10360	the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin;
01O	35	25		10370	and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid: Dan and Naphtali;
01O	35	26		10380	and the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, that were born to him in Paddan-aram.
01O	35	27		10390	And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
01O	35	28		10400	And the days of Isaac were a hundred and fourscore years.
01O	35	29		10410	And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.
01O	36	1		10420	Now these are the generations of Esau (the same is Edom).
01O	36	2		10430	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,
01O	36	3		10440	and Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.
01O	36	4		10450	And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Basemath bare Reuel;
01O	36	5		10460	and Oholibamah bare Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, that were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
01O	36	6		10470	And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and all his possessions, which he had gather in the land of Canaan; and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.
01O	36	7		10480	For their substance was too great for them to dwell together; and the land of their sojournings could not bear them because of their cattle.
01O	36	8		10490	And Esau dwelt in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.
01O	36	9		10500	And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in mount Seir:
01O	36	10		10510	these are the names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Basemath the wife of Esau.
01O	36	11		10520	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.
01O	36	12		10530	And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.
01O	36	13		10540	And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah: these were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.
01O	36	14		10550	And these were the sons of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.
01O	36	15		10560	These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-born of Esau: chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,
01O	36	16		10570	chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek: these are the chiefs that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
01O	36	17		10580	And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son: chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah: these are the chiefs that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.
01O	36	18		10590	And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife: chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs that came of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.
01O	36	19		10600	These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: the same is Edom.
01O	36	20		10610	These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah,
01O	36	21		10620	and Dishon and Ezer and Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.
01O	36	22		10630	And the children of Lotan were Hori and Heman. And Lotan's sister was Timna.
01O	36	23		10640	And these are the children of Shobal: Alvan and Manahath and Ebal, Shepho and Onam.
01O	36	24		10650	And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah; this is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
01O	36	25		10660	And these are the children of Anah: Dishon and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah.
01O	36	26		10670	And these are the children of Dishon: Hemdan and Eshban and Ithran and Cheran.
01O	36	27		10680	These are the children of Ezer: Bilhan and Zaavan and Akan.
01O	36	28		10690	These are the children of Dishan: Uz and Aran.
01O	36	29		10700	These are the chiefs that came of the Horites: chief Lotan, chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,
01O	36	30		10710	chief Dishon, chief Ezer, chief Dishan: these are the chiefs that came of the Horites, according to their chiefs in the land of Seir.
01O	36	31		10720	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.
01O	36	32		10730	And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom; and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
01O	36	33		10740	And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead.
01O	36	34		10750	And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his stead.
01O	36	35		10760	And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Avith.
01O	36	36		10770	And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
01O	36	37		10780	And Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the River reigned in his stead.
01O	36	38		10790	And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.
01O	36	39		10800	And Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Me-zahab.
01O	36	40		10810	And these are the names of the chiefs that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
01O	36	41		10820	chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
01O	36	42		10830	chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
01O	36	43		10840	chief Magdiel, chief Iram: these are the chiefs of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
01O	37	1		10850	And Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
01O	37	2		10860	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought the evil report of them unto their father.
01O	37	3		10870	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.
01O	37	4		10880	And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
01O	37	5		10890	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
01O	37	6		10900	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
01O	37	7		10910	for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
01O	37	8		10920	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
01O	37	9		10930	And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream: and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
01O	37	10		10940	And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
01O	37	11		10950	And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.
01O	37	12		10960	And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
01O	37	13		10970	And Israel said unto Joseph, Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
01O	37	14		10980	And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
01O	37	15		10990	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
01O	37	16		11000	And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding [the flock].
01O	37	17		11010	And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
01O	37	18		11020	And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
01O	37	19		11030	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
01O	37	20		11040	Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, And evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
01O	37	21		11050	And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.
01O	37	22		11060	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
01O	37	23		11070	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;
01O	37	24		11080	and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
01O	37	25		11090	And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
01O	37	26		11100	And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
01O	37	27		11110	Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.
01O	37	28		11120	And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
01O	37	29		11130	And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
01O	37	30		11140	And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
01O	37	31		11150	And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood;
01O	37	32		11160	and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son's coat or not.
01O	37	33		11170	And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces.
01O	37	34		11180	And Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
01O	37	35		11190	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning. And his father wept for him.
01O	37	36		11200	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.
01O	38	1		11210	And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
01O	38	2		11220	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua. And he took her, and went in unto her.
01O	38	3		11230	And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
01O	38	4		11240	And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
01O	38	5		11250	And she yet again bare a son, and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.
01O	38	6		11260	And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.
01O	38	7		11270	And Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah. And Jehovah slew him.
01O	38	8		11280	And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
01O	38	9		11290	And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.
01O	38	10		11300	And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah: and he slew him also.
01O	38	11		11310	Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
01O	38	12		11320	And in process of time Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheep-shearers to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
01O	38	13		11330	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his sheep.
01O	38	14		11340	And she put off from her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him to wife.
01O	38	15		11350	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; for she had covered her face.
01O	38	16		11360	And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee: for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
01O	38	17		11370	And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?
01O	38	18		11380	And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy cord, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
01O	38	19		11390	And she arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.
01O	38	20		11400	And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand: but he found her not.
01O	38	21		11410	Then he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the wayside? And they said, There hath been no prostitute here.
01O	38	22		11420	And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There hath been no prostitute here.
01O	38	23		11430	And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be put to shame: behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
01O	38	24		11440	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
01O	38	25		11450	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and the cords, and the staff.
01O	38	26		11460	And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more righteous than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
01O	38	27		11470	And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
01O	38	28		11480	And it came to pass, when she travailed, that one put out a hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
01O	38	29		11490	And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself? Therefore his name was called Perez.
01O	38	30		11500	And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zerah.
01O	39	1		11510	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.
01O	39	2		11520	And Jehovah was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
01O	39	3		11530	And his master saw that Jehovah was with him, and that Jehovah made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
01O	39	4		11540	And Joseph found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
01O	39	5		11550	And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that Jehovah blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Jehovah was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
01O	39	6		11560	And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not aught [that was] with him, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was comely, and well-favored.
01O	39	7		11570	And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
01O	39	8		11580	But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand:
01O	39	9		11590	he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?
01O	39	10		11600	And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, [or] to be with her.
01O	39	11		11610	And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
01O	39	12		11620	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
01O	39	13		11630	And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth,
01O	39	14		11640	that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice:
01O	39	15		11650	and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.
01O	39	16		11660	And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.
01O	39	17		11670	And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:
01O	39	18		11680	and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.
01O	39	19		11690	And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
01O	39	20		11700	And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
01O	39	21		11710	But Jehovah was with Joseph, and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
01O	39	22		11720	And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
01O	39	23		11730	The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand, because Jehovah was with him; and that which he did, Jehovah made it prosper.
01O	40	1		11740	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
01O	40	2		11750	And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
01O	40	3		11760	And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.
01O	40	4		11770	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.
01O	40	5		11780	And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
01O	40	6		11790	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.
01O	40	7		11800	And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in ward in his master's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day?
01O	40	8		11810	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell it me, I pray you.
01O	40	9		11820	And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;
01O	40	10		11830	and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, [and] its blossoms shot forth; [and] the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes:
01O	40	11		11840	and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand.
01O	40	12		11850	And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days;
01O	40	13		11860	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
01O	40	14		11870	But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:
01O	40	15		11880	for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
01O	40	16		11890	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head:
01O	40	17		11900	and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
01O	40	18		11910	And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days;
01O	40	19		11920	within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
01O	40	20		11930	And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
01O	40	21		11940	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:
01O	40	22		11950	but he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.
01O	40	23		11960	Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.
01O	41	1		11970	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
01O	41	2		11980	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, well-favored and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the reed-grass.
01O	41	3		11990	And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill-favored and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river.
01O	41	4		12000	And the ill-favored and lean-fleshed kine did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.
01O	41	5		12010	And he slept and dreamed a second time: and, behold, seven ears of grain came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
01O	41	6		12020	And, behold, seven ears, thin and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
01O	41	7		12030	And the thin ears swallowed up the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
01O	41	8		12040	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
01O	41	9		12050	Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
01O	41	10		12060	Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker:
01O	41	11		12070	and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
01O	41	12		12080	And there was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
01O	41	13		12090	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
01O	41	14		12100	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
01O	41	15		12110	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that when thou hearest a dream thou canst interpret it.
01O	41	16		12120	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
01O	41	17		12130	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the brink of the river:
01O	41	18		12140	and, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fat-fleshed and well-favored: and they fed in the reed-grass:
01O	41	19		12150	and, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill-favored and lean-fleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
01O	41	20		12160	and the lean and ill-favored kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
01O	41	21		12170	and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill-favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
01O	41	22		12180	And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good:
01O	41	23		12190	and, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, [and] blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:
01O	41	24		12200	and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears: and I told it unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.
01O	41	25		12210	And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: what God is about to do he hath declared unto Pharaoh.
01O	41	26		12220	The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.
01O	41	27		12230	And the seven lean and ill-favored kine that came up after them are seven years, and also the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind; they shall be seven years of famine.
01O	41	28		12240	That is the thing which I spake unto Pharaoh: what God is about to do he hath showed unto Pharaoh.
01O	41	29		12250	Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:
01O	41	30		12260	and there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
01O	41	31		12270	and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine which followeth; for it shall be very grievous.
01O	41	32		12280	And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
01O	41	33		12290	Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
01O	41	34		12300	Let Pharaoh do [this], and let him appoint overseers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
01O	41	35		12310	And let them gather all the food of these good years that come, and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.
01O	41	36		12320	And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.
01O	41	37		12330	And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.
01O	41	38		12340	And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom the spirit of God is?
01O	41	39		12350	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath showed thee all of this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou:
01O	41	40		12360	thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
01O	41	41		12370	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
01O	41	42		12380	And Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;
01O	41	43		12390	and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he set him over all the land of Egypt.
01O	41	44		12400	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt.
01O	41	45		12410	And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On. And Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
01O	41	46		12420	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
01O	41	47		12430	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
01O	41	48		12440	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.
01O	41	49		12450	And Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.
01O	41	50		12460	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On, bare unto him.
01O	41	51		12470	And Joseph called the name of the first-born Manasseh: For, [said he], God hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house.
01O	41	52		12480	And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
01O	41	53		12490	And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, came to an end.
01O	41	54		12500	And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said: and there was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
01O	41	55		12510	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
01O	41	56		12520	And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the store-houses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine was sore in the land of Egypt.
01O	41	57		12530	And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was sore in all the earth.
01O	42	1		12540	Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
01O	42	2		12550	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
01O	42	3		12560	And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.
01O	42	4		12570	But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him.
01O	42	5		12580	And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
01O	42	6		12590	And Joseph was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
01O	42	7		12600	And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spake roughly with them; and he said unto them. Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
01O	42	8		12610	And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
01O	42	9		12620	And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
01O	42	10		12630	And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
01O	42	11		12640	We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
01O	42	12		12650	And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
01O	42	13		12660	And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
01O	42	14		12670	And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
01O	42	15		12680	hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
01O	42	16		12690	Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
01O	42	17		12700	And he put them all together into ward three days.
01O	42	18		12710	And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live: for I fear God:
01O	42	19		12720	if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses:
01O	42	20		12730	and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
01O	42	21		12740	And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
01O	42	22		12750	And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
01O	42	23		12760	And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
01O	42	24		12770	And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spake to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
01O	42	25		12780	Then Joseph commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them provisions for the way: and thus was it done unto them.
01O	42	26		12790	And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.
01O	42	27		12800	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
01O	42	28		12810	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that God hath done unto us?
01O	42	29		12820	And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
01O	42	30		12830	The man, the lord of the land, spake roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
01O	42	31		12840	And we said unto him, We are true men; and we are no spies:
01O	42	32		12850	we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
01O	42	33		12860	And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take [grain for] the famine of your houses, and go your way;
01O	42	34		12870	and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.
01O	42	35		12880	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
01O	42	36		12890	And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
01O	42	37		12900	And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
01O	42	38		12910	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
01O	43	1		12920	And the famine was sore in the land.
01O	43	2		12930	And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the grain which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
01O	43	3		12940	And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
01O	43	4		12950	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
01O	43	5		12960	but if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.
01O	43	6		12970	And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother?
01O	43	7		12980	And they said, The man asked straitly concerning ourselves, and concerning our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye [another] brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we in any wise know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
01O	43	8		12990	And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones.
01O	43	9		13000	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever:
01O	43	10		13010	for except we had lingered, surely we had now returned a second time.
01O	43	11		13020	And their father Israel said unto them, If it be so now, do this: take of the choice fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spicery and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;
01O	43	12		13030	and take double money in your hand; and the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks carry again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:
01O	43	13		13040	take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:
01O	43	14		13050	and God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother and Benjamin. And if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.
01O	43	15		13060	And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.
01O	43	16		13070	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, Bring the men into the house, and slay, and make ready; for the men shall dine with me at noon.
01O	43	17		13080	And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men to Joseph's house.
01O	43	18		13090	And the men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
01O	43	19		13100	And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they spake unto him at the door of the house,
01O	43	20		13110	and said, Oh, my lord, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:
01O	43	21		13120	and it came to pass, when we came to the lodging-place, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.
01O	43	22		13130	And other money have we brought down in our hand to buy food: we know not who put our money in our sacks.
01O	43	23		13140	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
01O	43	24		13150	And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet. And he gave their asses provender.
01O	43	25		13160	And they made ready the present against Joseph's coming at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.
01O	43	26		13170	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed down themselves to him to the earth.
01O	43	27		13180	And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?
01O	43	28		13190	And they said, Thy servant our father is well, he is yet alive. And they bowed the head, and made obeisance.
01O	43	29		13200	And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin his brother, his mother's son, and said, Is this your youngest brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son.
01O	43	30		13210	And Joseph made haste; for his heart yearned over his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.
01O	43	31		13220	And he washed his face, and came out; and he refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.
01O	43	32		13230	And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, that did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
01O	43	33		13240	And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one with another.
01O	43	34		13250	And he took [and sent] messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.
01O	44	1		13260	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.
01O	44	2		13270	And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
01O	44	3		13280	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
01O	44	4		13290	[And] when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?
01O	44	5		13300	Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.
01O	44	6		13310	And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.
01O	44	7		13320	And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.
01O	44	8		13330	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?
01O	44	9		13340	With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.
01O	44	10		13350	And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.
01O	44	11		13360	Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.
01O	44	12		13370	And he searched, [and] began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.
01O	44	13		13380	Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.
01O	44	14		13390	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.
01O	44	15		13400	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?
01O	44	16		13410	And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.
01O	44	17		13420	And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.
01O	44	18		13430	Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
01O	44	19		13440	My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?
01O	44	20		13450	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.
01O	44	21		13460	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.
01O	44	22		13470	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
01O	44	23		13480	And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
01O	44	24		13490	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.
01O	44	25		13500	And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.
01O	44	26		13510	And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, expect our youngest brother be with us.
01O	44	27		13520	And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:
01O	44	28		13530	and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:
01O	44	29		13540	and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
01O	44	30		13550	Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;
01O	44	31		13560	it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not [with us], that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.
01O	44	32		13570	For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.
01O	44	33		13580	Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.
01O	44	34		13590	For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.
01O	45	1		13600	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood before him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
01O	45	2		13610	And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
01O	45	3		13620	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.
01O	45	4		13630	And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
01O	45	5		13640	And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.
01O	45	6		13650	For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.
01O	45	7		13660	And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.
01O	45	8		13670	So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
01O	45	9		13680	Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;
01O	45	10		13690	and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:
01O	45	11		13700	and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.
01O	45	12		13710	And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.
01O	45	13		13720	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.
01O	45	14		13730	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
01O	45	15		13740	And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.
01O	45	16		13750	And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.
01O	45	17		13760	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;
01O	45	18		13770	and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
01O	45	19		13780	Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.
01O	45	20		13790	Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
01O	45	21		13800	And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.
01O	45	22		13810	To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.
01O	45	23		13820	And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.
01O	45	24		13830	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.
01O	45	25		13840	And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.
01O	45	26		13850	And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.
01O	45	27		13860	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:
01O	45	28		13870	and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.
01O	46	1		13880	And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
01O	46	2		13890	And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
01O	46	3		13900	And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:
01O	46	4		13910	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
01O	46	5		13920	And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
01O	46	6		13930	And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:
01O	46	7		13940	his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons's daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.
01O	46	8		13950	And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born.
01O	46	9		13960	And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.
01O	46	10		13970	And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.
01O	46	11		13980	And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
01O	46	12		13990	And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
01O	46	13		14000	And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.
01O	46	14		14010	And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.
01O	46	15		14020	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.
01O	46	16		14030	And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.
01O	46	17		14040	And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.
01O	46	18		14050	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.
01O	46	19		14060	The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
01O	46	20		14070	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.
01O	46	21		14080	And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.
01O	46	22		14090	These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.
01O	46	23		14100	And the sons of Dan: Hushim.
01O	46	24		14110	And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.
01O	46	25		14120	These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.
01O	46	26		14130	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;
01O	46	27		14140	and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.
01O	46	28		14150	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
01O	46	29		14160	And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
01O	46	30		14170	And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.
01O	46	31		14180	And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
01O	46	32		14190	and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.
01O	46	33		14200	And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?
01O	46	34		14210	that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
01O	47	1		14220	Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
01O	47	2		14230	And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
01O	47	3		14240	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
01O	47	4		14250	And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants' flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
01O	47	5		14260	And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee:
01O	47	6		14270	the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
01O	47	7		14280	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
01O	47	8		14290	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How many are the days of the years of thy life?
01O	47	9		14300	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
01O	47	10		14310	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
01O	47	11		14320	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
01O	47	12		14330	And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.
01O	47	13		14340	And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
01O	47	14		14350	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.
01O	47	15		14360	And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for [our] money faileth.
01O	47	16		14370	And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
01O	47	17		14380	And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.
01O	47	18		14390	And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands:
01O	47	19		14400	wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.
01O	47	20		14410	So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh's.
01O	47	21		14420	And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
01O	47	22		14430	Only the land of the priests bought he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.
01O	47	23		14440	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
01O	47	24		14450	And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
01O	47	25		14460	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.
01O	47	26		14470	And Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh's.
01O	47	27		14480	And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
01O	47	28		14490	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.
01O	47	29		14500	And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt;
01O	47	30		14510	but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
01O	47	31		14520	And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head.
01O	48	1		14530	And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
01O	48	2		14540	And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
01O	48	3		14550	And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,
01O	48	4		14560	and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
01O	48	5		14570	And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.
01O	48	6		14580	And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
01O	48	7		14590	And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
01O	48	8		14600	And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?
01O	48	9		14610	And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
01O	48	10		14620	Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
01O	48	11		14630	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.
01O	48	12		14640	And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
01O	48	13		14650	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.
01O	48	14		14660	And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.
01O	48	15		14670	And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,
01O	48	16		14680	the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
01O	48	17		14690	And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.
01O	48	18		14700	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
01O	48	19		14710	And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it]. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
01O	48	20		14720	And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
01O	48	21		14730	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
01O	48	22		14740	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
01O	49	1		14750	And Jacob called unto his sons, and said: gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.
01O	49	2		14760	Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; And hearken unto Israel your father.
01O	49	3		14770	Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.
01O	49	4		14780	Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
01O	49	5		14790	Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.
01O	49	6		14800	O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man, And in their self-will they hocked an ox.
01O	49	7		14810	Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, And scatter them in Israel.
01O	49	8		14820	Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father's sons shall bow down before thee.
01O	49	9		14830	Judah is a lion's whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
01O	49	10		14840	The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come: And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.
01O	49	11		14850	Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass's colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:
01O	49	12		14860	His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.
01O	49	13		14870	Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Sidon.
01O	49	14		14880	Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:
01O	49	15		14890	And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork.
01O	49	16		14900	Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.
01O	49	17		14910	Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse's heels, So that his rider falleth backward.
01O	49	18		14920	I have waited for thy salvation, O Jehovah.
01O	49	19		14930	Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel.
01O	49	20		14940	Out of the Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties.
01O	49	21		14950	Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.
01O	49	22		14960	Joseph is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall.
01O	49	23		14970	The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecute him:
01O	49	24		14980	But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
01O	49	25		14990	Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
01O	49	26		15000	The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Joseph, And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
01O	49	27		15010	Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning she shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil.
01O	49	28		15020	All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
01O	49	29		15030	And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
01O	49	30		15040	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
01O	49	31		15050	there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:
01O	49	32		15060	the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.
01O	49	33		15070	And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
01O	50	1		15080	And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
01O	50	2		15090	And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
01O	50	3		15100	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him three-score and ten days.
01O	50	4		15110	And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
01O	50	5		15120	My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
01O	50	6		15130	And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
01O	50	7		15140	And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
01O	50	8		15150	and all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
01O	50	9		15160	And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
01O	50	10		15170	And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
01O	50	11		15180	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
01O	50	12		15190	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
01O	50	13		15200	for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
01O	50	14		15210	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
01O	50	15		15220	And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
01O	50	16		15230	And they sent a message unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
01O	50	17		15240	So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
01O	50	18		15250	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.
01O	50	19		15260	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
01O	50	20		15270	And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
01O	50	21		15280	Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
01O	50	22		15290	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.
01O	50	23		15300	And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.
01O	50	24		15310	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
01O	50	25		15320	And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
01O	50	26		15330	So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. 
02O	1	1		15340	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt (every man and his household came with Jacob):
02O	1	2		15350	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
02O	1	3		15360	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
02O	1	4		15370	Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.
02O	1	5		15380	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: and Joseph was in Egypt already.
02O	1	6		15390	And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
02O	1	7		15400	And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
02O	1	8		15410	Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
02O	1	9		15420	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:
02O	1	10		15430	come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they also join themselves unto our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.
02O	1	11		15440	Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh store-cities, Pithom and Raamses.
02O	1	12		15450	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.
02O	1	13		15460	And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor:
02O	1	14		15470	and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, wherein they made them serve with rigor.
02O	1	15		15480	And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:
02O	1	16		15490	and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.
02O	1	17		15500	But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men-children alive.
02O	1	18		15510	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men-children alive?
02O	1	19		15520	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwife come unto them.
02O	1	20		15530	And God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.
02O	1	21		15540	And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.
02O	1	22		15550	And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
02O	2	1		15560	And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.
02O	2	2		15570	And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.
02O	2	3		15580	And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink.
02O	2	4		15590	And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.
02O	2	5		15600	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.
02O	2	6		15610	And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.
02O	2	7		15620	Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?
02O	2	8		15630	And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother.
02O	2	9		15640	And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.
02O	2	10		15650	And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.
02O	2	11		15660	And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
02O	2	12		15670	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
02O	2	13		15680	And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
02O	2	14		15690	And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.
02O	2	15		15700	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.
02O	2	16		15710	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.
02O	2	17		15720	And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.
02O	2	18		15730	And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?
02O	2	19		15740	And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.
02O	2	20		15750	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.
02O	2	21		15760	And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.
02O	2	22		15770	And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.
02O	2	23		15780	And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.
02O	2	24		15790	And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
02O	2	25		15800	And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].
02O	3	1		15810	Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb.
02O	3	2		15820	And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
02O	3	3		15830	And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
02O	3	4		15840	And when Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.
02O	3	5		15850	And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
02O	3	6		15860	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.
02O	3	7		15870	And Jehovah said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;
02O	3	8		15880	and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
02O	3	9		15890	And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
02O	3	10		15900	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
02O	3	11		15910	And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
02O	3	12		15920	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
02O	3	13		15930	And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?
02O	3	14		15940	And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
02O	3	15		15950	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
02O	3	16		15960	Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and [seen] that which is done to you in Egypt:
02O	3	17		15970	and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
02O	3	18		15980	And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.
02O	3	19		15990	And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
02O	3	20		16000	And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
02O	3	21		16010	And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.
02O	3	22		16020	But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.
02O	4	1		16030	And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not appeared unto thee.
02O	4	2		16040	And Jehovah said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.
02O	4	3		16050	And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.
02O	4	4		16060	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand:)
02O	4	5		16070	That they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
02O	4	6		16080	And Jehovah said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as [white as] snow.
02O	4	7		16090	And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his [other] flesh.)
02O	4	8		16100	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
02O	4	9		16110	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
02O	4	10		16120	And Moses said unto Jehovah, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
02O	4	11		16130	And Jehovah said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? Or who maketh [a man] dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, Jehovah?
02O	4	12		16140	Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.
02O	4	13		16150	And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
02O	4	14		16160	And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
02O	4	15		16170	And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
02O	4	16		16180	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as God.
02O	4	17		16190	And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.
02O	4	18		16200	And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
02O	4	19		16210	And Jehovah said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.
02O	4	20		16220	And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
02O	4	21		16230	And Jehovah said unto Moses, When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.
02O	4	22		16240	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, Israel is my son, my first-born:
02O	4	23		16250	and I have said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.
02O	4	24		16260	And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that Jehovah met him, and sought to kill him.
02O	4	25		16270	Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me.
02O	4	26		16280	So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood [art thou], because of the circumcision.
02O	4	27		16290	And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mountain of God, and kissed him.
02O	4	28		16300	And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs wherewith he had charged him.
02O	4	29		16310	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:
02O	4	30		16320	and Aaron spake all the words which Jehovah had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
02O	4	31		16330	And the people believed: and when they heard that Jehovah had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
02O	5	1		16340	And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
02O	5	2		16350	And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and moreover I will not let Israel go.
02O	5	3		16360	And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto Jehovah our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
02O	5	4		16370	And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
02O	5	5		16380	And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
02O	5	6		16390	And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
02O	5	7		16400	Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
02O	5	8		16410	And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
02O	5	9		16420	Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.
02O	5	10		16430	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
02O	5	11		16440	Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.
02O	5	12		16450	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
02O	5	13		16460	And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.
02O	5	14		16470	And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?
02O	5	15		16480	Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
02O	5	16		16490	There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault it in thine own people.
02O	5	17		16500	But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.
02O	5	18		16510	Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
02O	5	19		16520	And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, [your] daily tasks.
02O	5	20		16530	And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:
02O	5	21		16540	and they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
02O	5	22		16550	And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?
02O	5	23		16560	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
02O	6	1		16570	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
02O	6	2		16580	And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah:
02O	6	3		16590	and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them.
02O	6	4		16600	And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.
02O	6	5		16610	And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.
02O	6	6		16620	Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:
02O	6	7		16630	and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
02O	6	8		16640	And I will bring you in unto the land which I sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for a heritage: I am Jehovah.
02O	6	9		16650	And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.
02O	6	10		16660	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	6	11		16670	Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
02O	6	12		16680	And Moses spake before Jehovah, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?
02O	6	13		16690	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
02O	6	14		16700	These are the heads of their fathers' houses. The sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.
02O	6	15		16710	And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman; these are the families of Simeon.
02O	6	16		16720	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred thirty and seven years.
02O	6	17		16730	The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, according to their families.
02O	6	18		16740	And the sons of Kohath: Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were a hundred thirty and three years.
02O	6	19		16750	And the sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their generations.
02O	6	20		16760	And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were a hundred and thirty and seven years.
02O	6	21		16770	And the sons of Izhar: Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
02O	6	22		16780	And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.
02O	6	23		16790	And Aaron took him Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
02O	6	24		16800	And the sons of Korah: Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korahites.
02O	6	25		16810	And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the Levites according to their families.
02O	6	26		16820	These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Jehovah said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their hosts.
02O	6	27		16830	These are they that spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.
02O	6	28		16840	And it came to pass on the day when Jehovah spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,
02O	6	29		16850	that Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, I am Jehovah: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak unto thee.
02O	6	30		16860	And Moses said before Jehovah, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
02O	7	1		16870	And Jehovah said unto Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
02O	7	2		16880	Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
02O	7	3		16890	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
02O	7	4		16900	But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
02O	7	5		16910	And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
02O	7	6		16920	And Moses and Aaron did so; as Jehovah commanded them, so did they.
02O	7	7		16930	And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
02O	7	8		16940	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
02O	7	9		16950	When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.
02O	7	10		16960	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
02O	7	11		16970	Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.
02O	7	12		16980	For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.
02O	7	13		16990	And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.
02O	7	14		17000	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go.
02O	7	15		17010	Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.
02O	7	16		17020	And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened.
02O	7	17		17030	Thus saith Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
02O	7	18		17040	And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.
02O	7	19		17050	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.
02O	7	20		17060	And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
02O	7	21		17070	And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
02O	7	22		17080	And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.
02O	7	23		17090	And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.
02O	7	24		17100	And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
02O	7	25		17110	And seven days were fulfilled, after that Jehovah had smitten the river.
02O	8	1		17120	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
02O	8	2		17130	And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
02O	8	3		17140	and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs:
02O	8	4		17150	and the frogs shall come up both upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.
02O	8	5		17160	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.
02O	8	6		17170	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.
02O	8	7		17180	And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
02O	8	8		17190	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat Jehovah, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice unto Jehovah.
02O	8	9		17200	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Have thou this glory over me: against what time shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?
02O	8	10		17210	And he said, Against to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like unto Jehovah our God.
02O	8	11		17220	And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.
02O	8	12		17230	And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto Jehovah concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.
02O	8	13		17240	And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.
02O	8	14		17250	And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land stank.
02O	8	15		17260	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken.
02O	8	16		17270	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that is may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
02O	8	17		17280	And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
02O	8	18		17290	And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: and there were lice upon man, and upon beast.
02O	8	19		17300	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as Jehovah had spoken.
02O	8	20		17310	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
02O	8	21		17320	Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.
02O	8	22		17330	And I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am Jehovah in the midst of the earth.
02O	8	23		17340	And I will put a division between my people and thy people: by to-morrow shall this sign be.
02O	8	24		17350	And Jehovah did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses: and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarms of flies.
02O	8	25		17360	And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.
02O	8	26		17370	And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?
02O	8	27		17380	We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.
02O	8	28		17390	And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me.
02O	8	29		17400	And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat Jehovah that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: only let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah.
02O	8	30		17410	And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
02O	8	31		17420	And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.
02O	8	32		17430	And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.
02O	9	1		17440	Then Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
02O	9	2		17450	For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,
02O	9	3		17460	behold, the hand of Jehovah is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: [there shall be] a very grievous murrain.
02O	9	4		17470	And Jehovah shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.
02O	9	5		17480	And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow Jehovah shall do this thing in the land.
02O	9	6		17490	And Jehovah did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
02O	9	7		17500	And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.
02O	9	8		17510	And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
02O	9	9		17520	And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
02O	9	10		17530	And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.
02O	9	11		17540	And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
02O	9	12		17550	And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses.
02O	9	13		17560	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
02O	9	14		17570	For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
02O	9	15		17580	For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth:
02O	9	16		17590	but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
02O	9	17		17600	As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?
02O	9	18		17610	Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
02O	9	19		17620	Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; [for] every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
02O	9	20		17630	He that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.
02O	9	21		17640	And he that regarded not the word of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field.
02O	9	22		17650	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
02O	9	23		17660	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and Jehovah sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and Jehovah rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
02O	9	24		17670	So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
02O	9	25		17680	And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
02O	9	26		17690	Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
02O	9	27		17700	And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
02O	9	28		17710	Entreat Jehovah; for there hath been enough of [these] mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
02O	9	29		17720	And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto Jehovah; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's.
02O	9	30		17730	But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear Jehovah God.
02O	9	31		17740	And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
02O	9	32		17750	But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
02O	9	33		17760	And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto Jehovah: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
02O	9	34		17770	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
02O	9	35		17780	And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.
02O	10	1		17790	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,
02O	10	2		17800	and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am Jehovah.
02O	10	3		17810	And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
02O	10	4		17820	Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:
02O	10	5		17830	and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:
02O	10	6		17840	and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
02O	10	7		17850	And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?
02O	10	8		17860	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve Jehovah your God; but who are they that shall go?
02O	10	9		17870	And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto Jehovah.
02O	10	10		17880	And he said unto them, So be Jehovah with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
02O	10	11		17890	Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve Jehovah; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.
02O	10	12		17900	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
02O	10	13		17910	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and Jehovah brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
02O	10	14		17920	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
02O	10	15		17930	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
02O	10	16		17940	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.
02O	10	17		17950	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat Jehovah your God, that he may take away from me this death only.
02O	10	18		17960	And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated Jehovah.
02O	10	19		17970	And Jehovah turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.
02O	10	20		17980	But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.
02O	10	21		17990	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
02O	10	22		18000	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days;
02O	10	23		18010	they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
02O	10	24		18020	And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve Jehovah; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
02O	10	25		18030	And Moses said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto Jehovah our God.
02O	10	26		18040	Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve Jehovah our God; and we know not with what we must serve Jehovah, until we come thither.
02O	10	27		18050	But Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.
02O	10	28		18060	And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
02O	10	29		18070	And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well. I will see thy face again no more.
02O	11	1		18080	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
02O	11	2		18090	Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
02O	11	3		18100	And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.
02O	11	4		18110	And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:
02O	11	5		18120	and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle.
02O	11	6		18130	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more.
02O	11	7		18140	But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that Jehovah doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.
02O	11	8		18150	And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
02O	11	9		18160	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
02O	11	10		18170	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
02O	12	1		18180	And Jehovah spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
02O	12	2		18190	This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.
02O	12	3		18200	Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth [day] of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household:
02O	12	4		18210	and if the household be too little for a lamb, then shall he and his neighbor next unto his house take one according to the number of the souls; according to every man's eating ye shall make your count for the lamb.
02O	12	5		18220	Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old: ye shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:
02O	12	6		18230	and ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month; and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it at even.
02O	12	7		18240	And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side-posts and on the lintel, upon the houses wherein they shall eat it.
02O	12	8		18250	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
02O	12	9		18260	Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with the inwards thereof.
02O	12	10		18270	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; but that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
02O	12	11		18280	And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is Jehovah's passover.
02O	12	12		18290	For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am Jehovah.
02O	12	13		18300	And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
02O	12	14		18310	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah: throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.
02O	12	15		18320	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
02O	12	16		18330	And in the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you.
02O	12	17		18340	And ye shall observe the [feast of] unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day throughout your generations by an ordinance for ever.
02O	12	18		18350	In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.
02O	12	19		18360	Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a sojourner, or one that is born in the land.
02O	12	20		18370	Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.
02O	12	21		18380	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover.
02O	12	22		18390	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
02O	12	23		18400	For Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
02O	12	24		18410	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
02O	12	25		18420	And it shall come to pass, when ye are come to the land which Jehovah will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
02O	12	26		18430	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
02O	12	27		18440	that ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of Jehovah's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
02O	12	28		18450	And the children of Israel went and did so; as Jehovah had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
02O	12	29		18460	And it came to pass at midnight, that Jehovah smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle.
02O	12	30		18470	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
02O	12	31		18480	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.
02O	12	32		18490	Take both your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
02O	12	33		18500	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, to send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men.
02O	12	34		18510	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading-troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
02O	12	35		18520	And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.
02O	12	36		18530	And Jehovah gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they let them have what they asked. And they despoiled the Egyptians.
02O	12	37		18540	And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children.
02O	12	38		18550	And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.
02O	12	39		18560	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals.
02O	12	40		18570	Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
02O	12	41		18580	And it came to pass at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.
02O	12	42		18590	It is a night to be much observed unto Jehovah for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of Jehovah, to be much observed of all the children of Israel throughout their generations.
02O	12	43		18600	And Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no foreigner eat thereof;
02O	12	44		18610	but every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.
02O	12	45		18620	A sojourner and a hired servant shall not eat thereof.
02O	12	46		18630	In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
02O	12	47		18640	All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.
02O	12	48		18650	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: but no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
02O	12	49		18660	One law shall be to him that is home-born, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.
02O	12	50		18670	Thus did all the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
02O	12	51		18680	And it came to pass the selfsame day, that Jehovah did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their hosts.
02O	13	1		18690	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	13	2		18700	Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
02O	13	3		18710	And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
02O	13	4		18720	This day ye go forth in the month Abib.
02O	13	5		18730	And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
02O	13	6		18740	Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to Jehovah.
02O	13	7		18750	Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders.
02O	13	8		18760	And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.
02O	13	9		18770	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath Jehovah brought thee out of Egypt.
02O	13	10		18780	Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
02O	13	11		18790	And it shall be, when Jehovah shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
02O	13	12		18800	that thou shalt set apart unto Jehovah all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be Jehovah's.
02O	13	13		18810	And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.
02O	13	14		18820	And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
02O	13	15		18830	and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that Jehovah slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem.
02O	13	16		18840	And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt.
02O	13	17		18850	And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:
02O	13	18		18860	but God led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
02O	13	19		18870	And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
02O	13	20		18880	And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
02O	13	21		18890	And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:
02O	13	22		18900	the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.
02O	14	1		18910	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	14	2		18920	Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.
02O	14	3		18930	And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.
02O	14	4		18940	And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.
02O	14	5		18950	And it was told the king of Egypt that the people were fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed towards the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
02O	14	6		18960	And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:
02O	14	7		18970	and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over all of them.
02O	14	8		18980	And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: for the children of Israel went out with a high hand.
02O	14	9		18990	And the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses [and] chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
02O	14	10		19000	And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians were marching after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto Jehovah.
02O	14	11		19010	And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
02O	14	12		19020	Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
02O	14	13		19030	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.
02O	14	14		19040	Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
02O	14	15		19050	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.
02O	14	16		19060	And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
02O	14	17		19070	And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall go in after them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
02O	14	18		19080	And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
02O	14	19		19090	And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud removed from before them, and stood behind them:
02O	14	20		19100	and it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night: and the one came not near the other all the night.
02O	14	21		19110	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah caused the sea to go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.
02O	14	22		19120	And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
02O	14	23		19130	And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
02O	14	24		19140	And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah looked forth upon the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of cloud, and discomfited the host of the Egyptians.
02O	14	25		19150	And he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily; so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for Jehovah fighteth for them against the Egyptians.
02O	14	26		19160	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.
02O	14	27		19170	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and Jehovah overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
02O	14	28		19180	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the host of Pharaoh that went in after them into the sea; there remained not so much as one of them.
02O	14	29		19190	But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.
02O	14	30		19200	Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore.
02O	14	31		19210	And Israel saw the great work which Jehovah did upon the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah: and they believed in Jehovah, and in his servant Moses.
02O	15	1		19220	Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto Jehovah, and spake, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
02O	15	2		19230	Jehovah is my strength and song, And he is become my salvation: This is my God, and I will praise him; My father's God, and I will exalt him.
02O	15	3		19240	Jehovah is a man of war: Jehovah is his name.
02O	15	4		19250	Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea; And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
02O	15	5		19260	The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone.
02O	15	6		19270	Thy right hand, O Jehovah, is glorious in power, Thy right hand, O Jehovah, dasheth in pieces the enemy.
02O	15	7		19280	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: Thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble.
02O	15	8		19290	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up, The floods stood upright as a heap; The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
02O	15	9		19300	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; My desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
02O	15	10		19310	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
02O	15	11		19320	Who is like unto thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
02O	15	12		19330	Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, The earth swallowed them.
02O	15	13		19340	Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.
02O	15	14		19350	The peoples have heard, they tremble: Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
02O	15	15		19360	Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
02O	15	16		19370	Terror and dread falleth upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, O Jehovah, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased.
02O	15	17		19380	Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place, O Jehovah, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
02O	15	18		19390	Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever.
02O	15	19		19400	For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
02O	15	20		19410	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
02O	15	21		19420	And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to Jehovah, for he hath triumphed gloriously; The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
02O	15	22		19430	And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
02O	15	23		19440	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
02O	15	24		19450	And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
02O	15	25		19460	An he cried unto Jehovah; And Jehovah showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them;
02O	15	26		19470	and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am Jehovah that healeth thee.
02O	15	27		19480	And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
02O	16	1		19490	And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
02O	16	2		19500	And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness:
02O	16	3		19510	and the children of Israel said unto them, Would that we had died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
02O	16	4		19520	Then said Jehovah unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not.
02O	16	5		19530	And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
02O	16	6		19540	And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that Jehovah hath brought you out from the land of Egypt;
02O	16	7		19550	and in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of Jehovah; for that he heareth your murmurings against Jehovah: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?
02O	16	8		19560	And Moses said, [This shall be], when Jehovah shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that Jehovah heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.
02O	16	9		19570	And Moses said unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before Jehovah; for he hath heard your murmurings.
02O	16	10		19580	And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the cloud.
02O	16	11		19590	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	16	12		19600	I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.
02O	16	13		19610	And it came to pass at even, that the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the camp.
02O	16	14		19620	And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness a small round thing, small as the hoar-frost on the ground.
02O	16	15		19630	And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is it? For they knew not what it was. And Moses said unto them, It is the bread which Jehovah hath given you to eat.
02O	16	16		19640	This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Gather ye of it every man according to his eating; an omer a head, according to the number of your persons, shall ye take it, every man for them that are in his tent.
02O	16	17		19650	And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.
02O	16	18		19660	And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.
02O	16	19		19670	And Moses said unto them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
02O	16	20		19680	Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul: and Moses was wroth with them.
02O	16	21		19690	And they gathered it morning by morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
02O	16	22		19700	And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.
02O	16	23		19710	And he said unto them, This is that which Jehovah hath spoken, Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy sabbath unto Jehovah: bake that which ye will bake, and boil that which ye will boil; and all that remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
02O	16	24		19720	And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not become foul, neither was there any worm therein.
02O	16	25		19730	And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath unto Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.
02O	16	26		19740	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
02O	16	27		19750	And it came to pass on the seventh day, that there went out some of the people to gather, and they found none.
02O	16	28		19760	And Jehovah said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?
02O	16	29		19770	See, for that Jehovah hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.
02O	16	30		19780	So the people rested on the seventh day.
02O	16	31		19790	And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers [made] with honey.
02O	16	32		19800	And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah hath commanded, Let an omerful of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread wherewith I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.
02O	16	33		19810	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omerful of manna therein, and lay it up before Jehovah, to be kept throughout your generations.
02O	16	34		19820	As Jehovah commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.
02O	16	35		19830	And the children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat the manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
02O	16	36		19840	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
02O	17	1		19850	And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to the commandment of Jehovah, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.
02O	17	2		19860	Wherefore the people stove with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why strive ye with me? Wherefore do ye tempt Jehovah?
02O	17	3		19870	And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore hast thou brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
02O	17	4		19880	And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do unto this people? They are almost ready to stone me.
02O	17	5		19890	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and they rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go.
02O	17	6		19900	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
02O	17	7		19910	And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the striving of the children of Israel, and because they tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us, or not?
02O	17	8		19920	Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
02O	17	9		19930	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
02O	17	10		19940	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
02O	17	11		19950	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
02O	17	12		19960	But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; And his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
02O	17	13		19970	And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
02O	17	14		19980	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: that I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.
02O	17	15		19990	And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi;
02O	17	16		20000	And he said, Jehovah hath sworn: Jehovah will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.
02O	18	1		20010	Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, how that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.
02O	18	2		20020	And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away,
02O	18	3		20030	and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land:
02O	18	4		20040	and the name of the other was Eliezer; for [he said], The God of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
02O	18	5		20050	And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of God:
02O	18	6		20060	and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
02O	18	7		20070	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
02O	18	8		20080	And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how Jehovah delivered them.
02O	18	9		20090	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Jehovah had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
02O	18	10		20100	And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
02O	18	11		20110	Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.
02O	18	12		20120	And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.
02O	18	13		20130	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Moses from the morning unto the evening.
02O	18	14		20140	And when Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even?
02O	18	15		20150	And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of God:
02O	18	16		20160	when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.
02O	18	17		20170	And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
02O	18	18		20180	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
02O	18	19		20190	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God be with thee: be thou for the people to God-ward, and bring thou the causes unto God:
02O	18	20		20200	and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
02O	18	21		20210	Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:
02O	18	22		20220	and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear [the burden] with thee.
02O	18	23		20230	If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.
02O	18	24		20240	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
02O	18	25		20250	And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
02O	18	26		20260	And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
02O	18	27		20270	And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
02O	19	1		20280	In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
02O	19	2		20290	And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
02O	19	3		20300	And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:
02O	19	4		20310	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.
02O	19	5		20320	Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine:
02O	19	6		20330	and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
02O	19	7		20340	And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.
02O	19	8		20350	And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.
02O	19	9		20360	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto Jehovah.
02O	19	10		20370	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments,
02O	19	11		20380	and be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
02O	19	12		20390	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:
02O	19	13		20400	no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
02O	19	14		20410	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.
02O	19	15		20420	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.
02O	19	16		20430	And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.
02O	19	17		20440	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
02O	19	18		20450	And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
02O	19	19		20460	And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.
02O	19	20		20470	And Jehovah came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.
02O	19	21		20480	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto Jehovah to gaze, and many of them perish.
02O	19	22		20490	And let the priests also, that come near to Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest Jehovah break forth upon them.
02O	19	23		20500	And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
02O	19	24		20510	And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest he break forth upon them.
02O	19	25		20520	So Moses went down unto the people, and told them.
02O	20	1		20530	And God spake all these words, saying,
02O	20	2		20540	I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
02O	20	3		20550	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
02O	20	4		20560	Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness [of any thing] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.
02O	20	5		20570	Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them, for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,
02O	20	6		20580	and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.
02O	20	7		20590	Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.
02O	20	8		20600	Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.
02O	20	9		20610	Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;
02O	20	10		20620	but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:
02O	20	11		20630	for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
02O	20	12		20640	Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.
02O	20	13		20650	Thou shalt not kill.
02O	20	14		20660	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
02O	20	15		20670	Thou shalt not steal.
02O	20	16		20680	Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
02O	20	17		20690	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.
02O	20	18		20700	And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.
02O	20	19		20710	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.
02O	20	20		20720	And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.
02O	20	21		20730	And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
02O	20	22		20740	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.
02O	20	23		20750	Ye shall not make [other gods] with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.
02O	20	24		20760	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.
02O	20	25		20770	And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
02O	20	26		20780	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.
02O	21	1		20790	Now these are the ordinances which thou shalt set before them.
02O	21	2		20800	If thou buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
02O	21	3		20810	If he come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he be married, then his wife shall go out with him.
02O	21	4		20820	If his master give him a wife and she bear him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.
02O	21	5		20830	But if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free:
02O	21	6		20840	then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.
02O	21	7		20850	And if a man sell his daughter to be a maid-servant, she shall not go out as the men-servants do.
02O	21	8		20860	If she please not her master, who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a foreign people he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her.
02O	21	9		20870	And if he espouse her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
02O	21	10		20880	If he take him another [wife]; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.
02O	21	11		20890	And if he do not these three things unto her, then shall she go out for nothing, without money.
02O	21	12		20900	He that smiteth a man, so that he dieth, shall surely be put to death.
02O	21	13		20910	And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver [him] into his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.
02O	21	14		20920	And if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbor, to slay him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
02O	21	15		20930	And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.
02O	21	16		20940	And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
02O	21	17		20950	And he that curseth his father or his mother, shall surely be put to death.
02O	21	18		20960	And if men contend, and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keep his bed;
02O	21	19		20970	if he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
02O	21	20		20980	And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die under his hand; he shall surely be punished.
02O	21	21		20990	Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.
02O	21	22		21000	And if men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart, and yet no harm follow; he shall be surely fined, according as the woman's husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
02O	21	23		21010	But if any harm follow, then thou shalt give life for life,
02O	21	24		21020	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
02O	21	25		21030	burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
02O	21	26		21040	And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, and destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.
02O	21	27		21050	And if he smite out his man-servant's tooth, or his maid-servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.
02O	21	28		21060	And if an ox gore a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be surely stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.
02O	21	29		21070	But if the ox was wont to gore in time past, and it hath been testified to its owner, and he hath not kept it in, but it hath killed a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death.
02O	21	30		21080	If there be laid on him a ransom, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.
02O	21	31		21090	Whether it have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
02O	21	32		21100	If the ox gore a man-servant or a maid-servant, there shall be given unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
02O	21	33		21110	And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein,
02O	21	34		21120	the owner of the pit shall make it good; he shall give money unto the owner thereof, and the dead [beast] shall be his.
02O	21	35		21130	And if one man's ox hurt another's, so that it dieth, then they shall sell the live ox, and divide the price of it: and the dead also they shall divide.
02O	21	36		21140	Or if it be known that the ox was wont to gore in time past, and its owner hath not kept it in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead [beast] shall be his own.
02O	22	1		21150	If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
02O	22	2		21160	If the thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.
02O	22	3		21170	If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him; he shall make restitution: if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
02O	22	4		21180	If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.
02O	22	5		21190	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man's field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
02O	22	6		21200	If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
02O	22	7		21210	If a man shall deliver unto his neighbor money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double.
02O	22	8		21220	If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, [to see] whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods.
02O	22	9		21230	For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith, This is it, the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbor.
02O	22	10		21240	If a man deliver unto his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it:
02O	22	11		21250	the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, whether he hath not put his hand unto his neighbor's goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.
02O	22	12		21260	But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.
02O	22	13		21270	If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness: he shall not make good that which was torn.
02O	22	14		21280	And if a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.
02O	22	15		21290	If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good: if it be a hired thing, it came for its hire.
02O	22	16		21300	And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.
02O	22	17		21310	If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
02O	22	18		21320	Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.
02O	22	19		21330	Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
02O	22	20		21340	He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto Jehovah only, shall be utterly destroyed.
02O	22	21		21350	And a sojourner shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him: for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
02O	22	22		21360	Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.
02O	22	23		21370	If thou afflict them at all, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
02O	22	24		21380	and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
02O	22	25		21390	If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest.
02O	22	26		21400	If thou at all take thy neighbor's garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down:
02O	22	27		21410	for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? And it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.
02O	22	28		21420	Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.
02O	22	29		21430	Thou shalt not delay to offer of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
02O	22	30		21440	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, [and] with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
02O	22	31		21450	And ye shall be holy men unto me: therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
02O	23	1		21460	Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
02O	23	2		21470	Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest [justice]:
02O	23	3		21480	neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause.
02O	23	4		21490	If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
02O	23	5		21500	If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt forbear to leave him, thou shalt surely release [it] with him.
02O	23	6		21510	Thou shalt not wrest the justice [due] to thy poor in his cause.
02O	23	7		21520	Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
02O	23	8		21530	And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
02O	23	9		21540	And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
02O	23	10		21550	And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof:
02O	23	11		21560	but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, [and] with thy oliveyard.
02O	23	12		21570	Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed.
02O	23	13		21580	And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
02O	23	14		21590	Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
02O	23	15		21600	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty:
02O	23	16		21610	and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field.
02O	23	17		21620	Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord Jehovah.
02O	23	18		21630	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.
02O	23	19		21640	The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in it mother's milk.
02O	23	20		21650	Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
02O	23	21		21660	Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him.
02O	23	22		21670	But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
02O	23	23		21680	For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off.
02O	23	24		21690	Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars.
02O	23	25		21700	And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
02O	23	26		21710	There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
02O	23	27		21720	I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
02O	23	28		21730	And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
02O	23	29		21740	I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.
02O	23	30		21750	By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
02O	23	31		21760	And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
02O	23	32		21770	Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
02O	23	33		21780	They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
02O	24	1		21790	And he said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off:
02O	24	2		21800	and Moses alone shall come near unto Jehovah; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.
02O	24	3		21810	And Moses came and told the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which Jehovah hath spoken will we do.
02O	24	4		21820	And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
02O	24	5		21830	And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto Jehovah.
02O	24	6		21840	And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
02O	24	7		21850	And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that Jehovah hath spoken will we do, and be obedient.
02O	24	8		21860	And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these words.
02O	24	9		21870	Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
02O	24	10		21880	And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.
02O	24	11		21890	And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld God, and did eat and drink.
02O	24	12		21900	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.
02O	24	13		21910	And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Moses went up into the mount of God.
02O	24	14		21920	And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.
02O	24	15		21930	And Moses went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.
02O	24	16		21940	And the glory of Jehovah abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.
02O	24	17		21950	And the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.
02O	24	18		21960	And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
02O	25	1		21970	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	25	2		21980	Speak unto the children of Israel, that they take for me an offering: of every man whose heart maketh him willing ye shall take my offering.
02O	25	3		21990	And this is the offering which ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and brass,
02O	25	4		22000	and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair],
02O	25	5		22010	and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood,
02O	25	6		22020	oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense,
02O	25	7		22030	onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
02O	25	8		22040	And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.
02O	25	9		22050	According to all that I show thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the furniture thereof, even so shall ye make it.
02O	25	10		22060	And they shall make an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
02O	25	11		22070	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.
02O	25	12		22080	And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four feet thereof; and two rings shall be on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
02O	25	13		22090	And thou shalt make staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
02O	25	14		22100	And thou shalt put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, wherewith to bear the ark.
02O	25	15		22110	The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.
02O	25	16		22120	And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
02O	25	17		22130	And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
02O	25	18		22140	And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat.
02O	25	19		22150	And make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.
02O	25	20		22160	And the cherubim shall spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.
02O	25	21		22170	And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
02O	25	22		22180	And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.
02O	25	23		22190	And thou shalt make a table of acacia wood: two cubits [shall be] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
02O	25	24		22200	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.
02O	25	25		22210	And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about; and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.
02O	25	26		22220	And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.
02O	25	27		22230	Close by the border shall the rings be, for places for the staves to bear the table.
02O	25	28		22240	And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.
02O	25	29		22250	And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the flagons thereof, and the bowls thereof, wherewith to pour out: of pure gold shalt thou make them.
02O	25	30		22260	And thou shalt set upon the table showbread before me alway.
02O	25	31		22270	And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it.
02O	25	32		22280	And there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:
02O	25	33		22290	three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick:
02O	25	34		22300	and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;
02O	25	35		22310	and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.

02O	29	28		23650	and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as [their] portion for ever from the children of Israel; for it is a heave-offering: and it shall be a heave-offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifices of their peace-offerings, even their heave-offering unto Jehovah.
02O	29	29		23660	And the holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.
02O	29	30		23670	Seven days shall the son that is priest in his stead put them on, when he cometh into the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.
02O	29	31		23680	And thou shalt take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh in a holy place.

02O	29	33		23700	And they shall eat those things wherewith atonement was made, to consecrate [and] to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy.
02O	29	34		23710	And if aught of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.
02O	29	35		23720	And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them.
02O	29	36		23730	And every day shalt thou offer the bullock of sin-offering for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou makest atonement for it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it.
02O	29	37		23740	Seven days thou shalt make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it: and the altar shall be most holy; whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy.
02O	29	38		23750	Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs a year old day by day continually.
02O	29	39		23760	The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even:
02O	29	40		23770	and with the one lamb a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink-offering.
02O	29	41		23780	And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto according to the meal-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering thereof, for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.

02O	29	43		23800	And there I will meet with the children of Israel; and [the Tent] shall be sanctified by my glory.
02O	29	44		23810	And I will sanctify the tent of meeting, and the altar: Aaron also and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to me in the priest's office.
02O	29	45		23820	And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
02O	29	46		23830	And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am Jehovah their God.
02O	30	1		23840	And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it.
02O	30	2		23850	A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it.
02O	30	3		23860	And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.
02O	30	4		23870	And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof; upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it.
02O	30	5		23880	And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
02O	30	6		23890	And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.
02O	30	7		23900	And Aaron shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it.
02O	30	8		23910	And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.
02O	30	9		23920	Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon.
02O	30	10		23930	And Aaron shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto Jehovah.
02O	30	11		23940	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	30	12		23950	When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto Jehovah, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.
02O	30	13		23960	This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to Jehovah.
02O	30	14		23970	Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of Jehovah.
02O	30	15		23980	The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
02O	30	16		23990	And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.
02O	30	17		24000	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	30	18		24010	Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash. And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
02O	30	19		24020	And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
02O	30	20		24030	when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.
02O	30	21		24040	So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
02O	30	22		24050	Moreover Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	30	23		24060	Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred [shekels], and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty,
02O	30	24		24070	and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.
02O	30	25		24080	And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.
02O	30	26		24090	And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,
02O	30	27		24100	and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense,
02O	30	28		24110	and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof.
02O	30	29		24120	And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.
02O	30	30		24130	And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.
02O	30	31		24140	And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.
02O	30	32		24150	Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, [and] it shall be holy unto you.
02O	30	33		24160	Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.
02O	30	34		24170	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight;
02O	30	35		24180	and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure [and] holy:
02O	30	36		24190	and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.
02O	30	37		24200	And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for Jehovah.
02O	30	38		24210	Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.
02O	31	1		24220	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	31	2		24230	See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:
02O	31	3		24240	and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,
02O	31	4		24250	to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
02O	31	5		24260	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.
02O	31	6		24270	And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all that are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:
02O	31	7		24280	the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent,
02O	31	8		24290	and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense,
02O	31	9		24300	and the altar of burnt-offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base,
02O	31	10		24310	and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office,
02O	31	11		24320	and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.
02O	31	12		24330	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	31	13		24340	Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am Jehovah who sanctifieth you.
02O	31	14		24350	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death; for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
02O	31	15		24360	Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work on the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.
02O	31	16		24370	Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.
02O	31	17		24380	It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.
02O	31	18		24390	And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
02O	32	1		24400	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
02O	32	2		24410	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden rings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
02O	32	3		24420	And all the people brake off the golden rings which were in their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.
02O	32	4		24430	And he received it at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made it a molten calf: and they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
02O	32	5		24440	And when Aaron saw [this], he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To-morrow shall be a feast to Jehovah.
02O	32	6		24450	And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt-offerings, and brought peace-offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.
02O	32	7		24460	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, that thou broughtest up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:
02O	32	8		24470	they have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed unto it, and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
02O	32	9		24480	And Jehovah said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:
02O	32	10		24490	now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation.
02O	32	11		24500	And Moses besought Jehovah his God, and said, Jehovah, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, that thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
02O	32	12		24510	Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying, For evil did he bring them forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.
02O	32	13		24520	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
02O	32	14		24530	And Jehovah repented of the evil which he said he would do unto his people.
02O	32	15		24540	And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, with the two tables of the testimony in his hand; tables that were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
02O	32	16		24550	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
02O	32	17		24560	And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
02O	32	18		24570	And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome; but the noise of them that sing do I hear.
02O	32	19		24580	And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
02O	32	20		24590	And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.
02O	32	21		24600	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought a great sin upon them?
02O	32	22		24610	And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are [set] on evil.
02O	32	23		24620	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
02O	32	24		24630	And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off: so they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.
02O	32	25		24640	And when Moses saw that the people were broken loose, (for Aaron had let them loose for a derision among their enemies,)
02O	32	26		24650	then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoso is on Jehovah's side, [let him come] unto me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him.
02O	32	27		24660	And he said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.
02O	32	28		24670	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
02O	32	29		24680	And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah, yea, every man against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day.
02O	32	30		24690	And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto Jehovah; peradventure I shall make atonement for your sin.
02O	32	31		24700	And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.
02O	32	32		24710	Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.
02O	32	33		24720	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.
02O	32	34		24730	And now go, lead the people unto [the place] of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them.
02O	32	35		24740	And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.
02O	33	1		24750	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:
02O	33	2		24760	and I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:
02O	33	3		24770	unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiffnecked people, lest I consume thee in the way.
02O	33	4		24780	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
02O	33	5		24790	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
02O	33	6		24800	And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from mount Horeb onward.
02O	33	7		24810	Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it without the camp, afar off from the camp; and he called it, The tent of meeting. And it came to pass, that every one that sought Jehovah went out unto the tent of meeting, which was without the camp.
02O	33	8		24820	And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the Tent, that all the people rose up, and stood, every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the Tent.
02O	33	9		24830	And it came to pass, when Moses entered into the Tent, the pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the door of the Tent: and [Jehovah] spake with Moses.
02O	33	10		24840	And all the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door of the Tent: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man at his tent door.
02O	33	11		24850	And Jehovah spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his minister Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the Tent.
02O	33	12		24860	And Moses said unto Jehovah, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found favor in my sight.
02O	33	13		24870	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thy sight, show me now thy ways, that I may know thee, to the end that I may find favor in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people.
02O	33	14		24880	And he said, My presence shall go [with thee], and I will give thee rest.
02O	33	15		24890	And he said unto him, If thy presence go not [with me], carry us not up hence.
02O	33	16		24900	For wherein now shall it be known that I have found favor in thy sight, I and thy people? is it not in that thou goest with us, so that we are separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth?
02O	33	17		24910	And Jehovah said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken; for thou hast found favor in my sight, and I know thee by name.
02O	33	18		24920	And he said, Show me, I pray thee, thy glory.
02O	33	19		24930	And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
02O	33	20		24940	And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for man shall not see me and live.
02O	33	21		24950	and Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock:
02O	33	22		24960	and it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by:
02O	33	23		24970	and I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back; but my face shall not be seen.
02O	34	1		24980	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest.
02O	34	2		24990	And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
02O	34	3		25000	And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
02O	34	4		25010	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.
02O	34	5		25020	And Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
02O	34	6		25030	And Jehovah passed by before him, and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,
02O	34	7		25040	keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
02O	34	8		25050	And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
02O	34	9		25060	And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
02O	34	10		25070	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of Jehovah; for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee.
02O	34	11		25080	Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
02O	34	12		25090	Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
02O	34	13		25100	but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim;
02O	34	14		25110	for thou shalt worship no other god: for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God:
02O	34	15		25120	lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice;
02O	34	16		25130	and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their gods, and make thy sons play the harlot after their gods.
02O	34	17		25140	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
02O	34	18		25150	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
02O	34	19		25160	All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep.
02O	34	20		25170	And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
02O	34	21		25180	Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
02O	34	22		25190	And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, [even] of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's end.
02O	34	23		25200	Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.
02O	34	24		25210	For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before Jehovah thy God three times in the year.
02O	34	25		25220	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
02O	34	26		25230	The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk.
02O	34	27		25240	And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
02O	34	28		25250	And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
02O	34	29		25260	And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
02O	34	30		25270	And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
02O	34	31		25280	And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses spake to them.
02O	34	32		25290	And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
02O	34	33		25300	And when Moses had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
02O	34	34		25310	But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
02O	34	35		25320	And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
02O	35	1		25330	And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which Jehovah hath commanded, that ye should do them.
02O	35	2		25340	Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to Jehovah: whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death.
02O	35	3		25350	Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
02O	35	4		25360	And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which Jehovah commanded, saying,
02O	35	5		25370	Take ye from among you an offering unto Jehovah; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, Jehovah's offering: gold, and silver, and brass,
02O	35	6		25380	and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair],
02O	35	7		25390	and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood,

02O	35	10		25420	And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that Jehovah hath commanded:
02O	35	11		25430	the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
02O	35	12		25440	the ark, and the staves thereof, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen;

02O	35	20		25520	And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
02O	35	21		25530	And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, [and] brought Jehovah's offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments.
02O	35	22		25540	And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, [and] brought brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man that offered an offering of gold unto Jehovah.
02O	35	23		25550	And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' [hair], and rams' skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them.
02O	35	24		25560	Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought Jehovah's offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
02O	35	25		25570	And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.
02O	35	26		25580	And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats' [hair].
02O	35	27		25590	And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;
02O	35	28		25600	and the spice, and the oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
02O	35	29		25610	The children of Israel brought a freewill-offering unto Jehovah; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which Jehovah had commanded to be made by Moses.
02O	35	30		25620	And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, Jehovah hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
02O	35	31		25630	And he hath filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;
02O	35	32		25640	and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,
02O	35	33		25650	and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.
02O	35	34		25660	And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
02O	35	35		25670	Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works.
02O	36	1		25680	And Bezalel and Oholiab shall work, and every wise-hearted man, in whom Jehovah hath put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that Jehovah hath commanded.
02O	36	2		25690	And Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart Jehovah had put wisdom, even every one whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:
02O	36	3		25700	and they received of Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, wherewith to make it. And they brought yet unto him freewill-offerings every morning.
02O	36	4		25710	And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they wrought.
02O	36	5		25720	And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work which Jehovah commanded to make.
02O	36	6		25730	And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing.
02O	36	7		25740	For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much.
02O	36	8		25750	And all the wise-hearted men among them that wrought the work made the tabernacle with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, [Bezalel] made them.
02O	36	9		25760	The length of each curtain was eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth of each curtain four cubits: all the curtains had one measure.
02O	36	10		25770	And he coupled five curtains one to another: and [the other] five curtains he coupled one to another.
02O	36	11		25780	And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.
02O	36	12		25790	Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling: the loops were opposite one to another.
02O	36	13		25800	And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the clasps: so the tabernacle was one.
02O	36	14		25810	And he made curtains of goats' [hair] for a tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.
02O	36	15		25820	The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of each curtain: the eleven curtains had one measure.
02O	36	16		25830	And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.
02O	36	17		25840	And he made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which was [outmost in] the second coupling.
02O	36	18		25850	And he made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
02O	36	19		25860	And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of sealskins above.
02O	36	20		25870	And he made the boards for the tabernacle, of acacia wood, standing up.
02O	36	21		25880	Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half the breadth of each board.
02O	36	22		25890	Each board had two tenons, joined one to another: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.
02O	36	23		25900	And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward.
02O	36	24		25910	And he made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
02O	36	25		25920	And for the second side of the tabernacle, on the north side, he made twenty boards,
02O	36	26		25930	and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
02O	36	27		25940	And for the hinder part of the tabernacle westward he made six boards.
02O	36	28		25950	And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the hinder part.
02O	36	29		25960	And they were double beneath; and in like manner they were entire unto the top thereof unto one ring: thus he did to both of them in the two corners.
02O	36	30		25970	And there were eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.
02O	36	31		25980	And he made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
02O	36	32		25990	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the hinder part westward.
02O	36	33		26000	And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the one end to the other.
02O	36	34		26010	And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.
02O	36	35		26020	And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: with cherubim, the work of the skilful workman, made he it.
02O	36	36		26030	And he made thereunto four pillars of acacia, and overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; And he cast for them four sockets of silver.
02O	36	37		26040	And he made a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of the embroiderer;
02O	36	38		26050	and the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their capitals and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets were of brass.
02O	37	1		26060	And Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:
02O	37	2		26070	and he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of gold to it round about.
02O	37	3		26080	And he cast for it four rings of gold, in the four feet thereof; even two rings on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it.
02O	37	4		26090	And he made staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.
02O	37	5		26100	And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
02O	37	6		26110	And he made a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half [was] the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
02O	37	7		26120	And he made two cherubim of gold; of beaten work made he them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat;
02O	37	8		26130	one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end: of one piece with the mercy-seat made he the cherubim at the two ends thereof.
02O	37	9		26140	And the cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy-seat with their wings, with their faces one to another; toward the mercy-seat were the faces of the cherubim.
02O	37	10		26150	And he made the table of acacia wood: two cubits [was] the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof:
02O	37	11		26160	and he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereto a crown of gold round about.
02O	37	12		26170	And he made unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and made a golden crown to the border thereof round about.
02O	37	13		26180	And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that were on the four feet thereof.
02O	37	14		26190	Close by the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.
02O	37	15		26200	And he made the staves of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold, to bear the table.
02O	37	16		26210	And he made the vessels which were upon the table, the dishes thereof, and the spoons thereof, and the bowls thereof, and the flagons thereof, wherewith to pour out, of pure gold.

02O	37	19		26240	three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower, and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick.
02O	37	20		26250	And in the candlestick were four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof;
02O	37	21		26260	and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of it.
02O	37	22		26270	Their knops and their branches were of one piece with it: the whole of it was one beaten work of pure gold.
02O	37	23		26280	And he made the lamps thereof, seven, and the snuffers thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, of pure gold.

02O	38	22		26560	And Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that Jehovah commanded Moses.

02O	38	27		26610	And the hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
02O	38	28		26620	And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five [shekels] he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their capitals, and made fillets for them.
02O	38	29		26630	And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand and four hundred shekels.
02O	38	30		26640	And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting, and the brazen altar, and the brazen grating for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

02O	39	3		26680	And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the skilful workman.
02O	39	4		26690	They made shoulder-pieces for it, joined together; at the two ends was it joined together.
02O	39	5		26700	And the skilfully woven band, that was upon it, wherewith to gird it on, was of the same piece [and] like the work thereof; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	39	6		26710	And they wrought the onyx stones, inclosed in settings of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel.
02O	39	7		26720	And he put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	39	8		26730	And he made the breastplate, the work of the skilful workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.
02O	39	9		26740	It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double.
02O	39	10		26750	And they set in it four rows of stones. A row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row;

02O	39	12		26770	and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;
02O	39	13		26780	and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jaspar: they were inclosed in inclosings of gold in their settings.
02O	39	14		26790	And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.
02O	39	15		26800	And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.
02O	39	16		26810	And they made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.
02O	39	17		26820	And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.
02O	39	18		26830	And the [other] two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof.
02O	39	19		26840	And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.
02O	39	20		26850	And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder-pieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the skilfully woven band of the ephod.
02O	39	21		26860	And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	39	22		26870	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.
02O	39	23		26880	And the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.
02O	39	24		26890	And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, [and] twined [linen].
02O	39	25		26900	And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;
02O	39	26		26910	a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	39	27		26920	And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,
02O	39	28		26930	and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly head-tires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,
02O	39	29		26940	and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	39	30		26950	And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.
02O	39	31		26960	And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	39	32		26970	Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses; so did they.
02O	39	33		26980	And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, it bars, and its pillars, and it sockets;
02O	39	34		26990	and the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;
02O	39	35		27000	the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;
02O	39	36		27010	the table, all the vessels thereof, and the showbread;
02O	39	37		27020	the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;
02O	39	38		27030	and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;
02O	39	39		27040	the brazen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;
02O	39	40		27050	the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;
02O	39	41		27060	the finely wrought garments for ministering in the holy place, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
02O	39	42		27070	According to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.
02O	39	43		27080	And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as Jehovah had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
02O	40	1		27090	And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,
02O	40	2		27100	On the first day of the first month shalt thou rear up the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
02O	40	3		27110	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and thou shalt screen the ark with the veil.
02O	40	4		27120	And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.
02O	40	5		27130	And thou shalt set the golden altar for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
02O	40	6		27140	And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting.
02O	40	7		27150	And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water therein.
02O	40	8		27160	And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the screen of the gate of the court.
02O	40	9		27170	And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the furniture thereof: and it shall be holy.
02O	40	10		27180	And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and sanctify the altar: and the altar shall be most holy.
02O	40	11		27190	And thou shalt anoint the laver and its base, and sanctify it.
02O	40	12		27200	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with water.
02O	40	13		27210	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.
02O	40	14		27220	And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them;
02O	40	15		27230	and thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: and their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
02O	40	16		27240	Thus did Moses: according to all that Jehovah commanded him, so did he.
02O	40	17		27250	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.
02O	40	18		27260	And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and laid its sockets, and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.
02O	40	19		27270	And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering of the tent above upon it; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	40	20		27280	And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on the ark, and put the mercy-seat above upon the ark:
02O	40	21		27290	and he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	40	22		27300	And he put the table in the tent of meeting, upon the side of the tabernacle northward, without the veil.
02O	40	23		27310	And he set the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	40	24		27320	And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting, over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.
02O	40	25		27330	And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	40	26		27340	And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil:
02O	40	27		27350	and he burnt thereon incense of sweet spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	40	28		27360	And he put the screen of the door to the tabernacle.
02O	40	29		27370	And he set the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered upon it the burnt-offering and the meal-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	40	30		27380	And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water therein, wherewith to wash.
02O	40	31		27390	And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet thereat;
02O	40	32		27400	when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses.
02O	40	33		27410	And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the screen of the gate of the court. So Moses finished the work.
02O	40	34		27420	Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
02O	40	35		27430	And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.
02O	40	36		27440	And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys:
02O	40	37		27450	but if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up.
02O	40	38		27460	For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the tabernacle by day, and there was fire therein by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.
