LXXM = The morphologically analyzed text of CATSS LXX prepared by CATSS
under the direction of R. Kraft (Philadelphia team).
<p />

<p />
PAR = Parallel Hebrew-Aramaic and Greek texts of Jewish 
Scripture, based on the Michigan-Claremont BHS consonantal text 
and the TLG LXX, created by the CATSS project under the direction 
of E. Tov (Jerusalem team). This data base currently is in a  
provisional form that will undergo continued modification as the  
CATSS project proceeds to its goals. Portions of PAR can be  
supplied by special arrangement.
<p />
which in turn derived from:
<p />
